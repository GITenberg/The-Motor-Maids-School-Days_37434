<h1>THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL DAYS</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—“THE COMET.”</h2>
<p>
“Girls, in about ten minutes you’re going to
have the surprise of your lives,” cried Nancy
Brown, joining a group of her friends at the
High School gate.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Nancy? Do tell us, please,” cried
half a dozen voices at once.
</p>
<p>
“No, you must wait,” answered Nancy. “If I
told you what it was, I wouldn’t enjoy seeing your
faces when the thing happened.”
</p>
<p>
“Nancy, you have always got some mystery on
foot,” put in her most intimate friend, Elinor
Butler. “Is this one animal, vegetable, or mineral?”
</p>
<p>
“Fine or superfine?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can it speak?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it as large as a house?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t all talk at once,” exclaimed Nancy.
“I’ll tell you this much. It’s animal and it’s superfine.
And”—she wrinkled her brows—“and
it’s mineral, too, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“Superfine? At least it’s a woman, then?”
cried all the girls in a chorus.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” laughed Nancy, who loved nothing better
than to excite the curiosity of her friends to
the utmost and then launch a genuine sensation
into their midst.
</p>
<p>
“Does the superfine animal wear the mineral?”
demanded Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“No, she doesn’t wear it. She’s in it.”
</p>
<p>
“In it? How strange,” exclaimed another girl.
“Perhaps it’s a lady oyster in her shell.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s no surprise in an oyster unless there’s
a pearl in it, goosey,” teased Nancy. “But here
it comes! Here it comes!” she cried, clapping her
hands joyfully, while six pairs of eyes peered curiously
down the street, which, by gentle degrees,
became a country road. The trim sidewalks of
the little seaport town of West Haven became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
grassy paths and the pretty lawns broadened into
flat green meadows.
</p>
<p>
Far down the road a brilliant red object could
be seen approaching. It was enveloped in a cloud
of dust and it moved with great rapidity.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s nothing but a red automobile,” cried
Elinor, in disappointment.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” admitted Nancy, “it’s an automobile,
but there’s something unusual about it besides its
color.”
</p>
<p>
“A girl is running it,” announced Mary Price,
whose clear, dark eyes always seemed to be looking
into the distance. “A girl is running it, and
no one is with her, and——”
</p>
<p>
But the motor car was now in full view. It
was a graceful little machine large enough to
hold five or six people comfortably, its body
painted a warm and pleasing shade of red, its
cushions upholstered in a slightly darker shade
which harmonized perfectly with the red of the
body. A young girl, sitting on the front seat,
was running the car as easily and steadily as an
experienced chauffeur. Making a graceful curve,
she turned into the driveway which led to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
school grounds and presently drew up under a
large shed, where people were in the habit of
hitching their horses and vehicles on Field Day,
or when football was in season.
</p>
<p>
“Who is she?” demanded Nancy’s schoolmates
in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she’s Miss Helen Campbell’s cousin,
Wilhelmina Campbell.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean our old friend, Billie?” asked
Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“The same,” said Nancy, in a low voice, for
Billie Campbell was now approaching within
hearing distance. “Her mother’s dead and her
father’s brought her here to live with Miss Campbell
while he builds a railroad in Russia, and she’s
going to High School and she’s in our class and
she’s coming to and fro every day in her own
motor car.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy was speaking as rapidly as a talking
machine going at full speed.
</p>
<p>
Billie, as her father had always called her,
might have guessed that she was the subject of all
this buzzing undertone of conversation among
the school girls; but she was too well accustomed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
strange faces and new places to feel
stiff and shy now at the looks of curiosity which
were turned on her. On the contrary, the West
Haven girls themselves felt a little ill at ease and
countrified in the presence of this new sophomore,
who, with her father, an engineer, had
lived in many countries and seen a great deal of
that mysterious outside world which sleepy, quiet
West Haven had never troubled itself much
about.
</p>
<p>
But Billie Campbell was not destined to renew
her acquaintance just then with these childhood
friends of hers. A slender, very pretty girl, beautifully
dressed, hurried out of the school building
and called:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Campbell, may I speak with you a
moment?”
</p>
<p>
“We might have known it,” cried Nancy
Brown savagely. “If Billie Campbell hadn’t
owned a motor car, Belle Rogers would never
have given herself the trouble even to speak to
her.”
</p>
<p>
You perhaps know what a dangerous quality
snobbishness is in a girl’s school. A very little of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
it is like a drop of strong poison in a pail of water.
It pollutes the whole pail. So it was at West
Haven High School. Belle Rogers, the prettiest
and richest girl in town, had picked out six more
or less wealthy and intimate friends in the sophomore
class and constituted herself leader of what
they called “The Mystic Seven.” These seven
girls held themselves aloof from the poorer girls
in the class and committed the unpardonable sin
of snubbing every girl outside their charmed circle.
</p>
<p>
Very bitter were the feelings of the other ten
sophomores against the “Mystic Seven,” who refused
to mingle in the sports of the class and
kept themselves apart at recess, talking in low,
mysterious voices and laughing behind their
pocket handkerchiefs when the other girls strolled
by.
</p>
<p>
“They always make me feel shabbier than I
really am,” Mary Price had once said.
</p>
<p>
And now the “Mystic Seven” had snatched up
this nice, athletic-looking, new sophomore, whom
many of them remembered as a bright, romping
little girl years before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose they’ll have to call themselves ‘The
Mystic Eight’ now,” said one of the girls, a little
bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we ask her to join the ‘Blue Birds’?”
put in Elinor Butler, who was eligible in point of
wealth to enter the richer society, but had coldly
declined the honor and had formed a society herself,
called the “Blue Birds.”
</p>
<p>
“She couldn’t belong to both clubs,” said
Nancy, “and you may be sure she has accepted
the invitation of that little golden-haired, blue-eyed
Belle Rogers, who put on an extra soft
pedal even to call out her name.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Billie Campbell will probably never have
cause to know that Belle’s tongue is sharper than
a serpent’s tooth, so what’s the odds,” observed
Mary Price philosophically. “We got on perfectly
well before she came and I suppose we can
manage to support life pretty comfortably even
if she is a member of the ‘Mystic Seven.’”
</p>
<p>
Her friends laughed, as they strolled by twos
and threes into the broad, arched entrance leading
into the corridor of the building. Mary
Price often relieved their wounded feelings by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
ending discussions concerning the “Mystic Seven”
with a joke, although not one of them had
been cut more deeply than she herself by the
cruel speeches of Belle Rogers and her friends;
for, since the death of Captain Price, Mary Price
and her mother, as you will see later, had had a
hard struggle to make both ends meet.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Belle Rogers was using all
her arts on the unsuspecting Wilhelmina Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“We have never met,” she was saying, “but I
heard you were going to enter our class and I
wanted to be the first to welcome you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said Billie, who had a boyish,
direct way of answering people.
</p>
<p>
“We wanted to know,” went on Belle quickly,
“if you wouldn’t become a member of our society,
the Mystic Seven. It is the most exclusive
and nicest society in the school; the seven nicest
girls in West Haven. We are all intimate friends,
you know.”
</p>
<p>
Billie gazed with admiration into Belle’s lovely,
childlike face. Her own hair was straight and
secretly she had always admired curls. Belle’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
pale golden hair curled about her low forehead
in soft ringlets. Her great china-blue eyes looked
appealingly into Billie’s gray ones, and her rosy
lips, which were much too thin when her face
was in repose, parted with a winning smile. She
was dressed in blue a little darker than her eyes
and a small blue velvet toque was perched coquettishly
on top of her curls.
</p>
<p>
“She looks like a picture pasted inside of an
old trunk mamma used to have,” said Billie to
herself. “I could almost believe she was a bisque
doll. I never saw anything like her.”
</p>
<p>
“You will join us, won’t you?” went on Belle
wistfully.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid I should be one too many and
make an unlucky number. Seven is supposed to
be lucky, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’re not superstitious,” laughed Belle.
“We can change the name to the ‘Happy Eight,’
or something of that sort. We are looking for
nice girls, and as soon as I saw you I knew you
would be the one for us. We want to enlarge the
club.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me,” said Billie thoughtfully, “in a class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
of seventeen girls are only seven nice enough to
be asked to join your club?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, they are nice enough,” replied Belle.
“Elinor Butler is really quite nice, but they are
not just our sort, don’t you know, and mamma
has always cautioned me to be very careful about
my companions.”
</p>
<p>
“Elinor Butler?” questioned Billie. “She is my
old friend, and Nancy Brown and Mary Price?
Aren’t any of them members?”
</p>
<p>
Just then the gong for chapel boomed out in
the September stillness and Belle could only shake
her head for denial, as the two girls hurried into
the building.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think I could ever get on with that
blonde doll baby,” thought Billie, as she followed
Belle into the chapel for morning prayer, which
always opened the day at West Haven High
School.
</p>
<p>
At recess the new sophomore was quite overwhelmed
by the attentions of the Mystic Seven.
They showed her the building and the grounds,
the class locker rooms and the gymnasium, which
interested her most of all. And in return she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
showed them her motor car. But, somehow, she
did not quite like these stylish and rather over-dressed
young girls. Their conversation really
bored her and she was disappointed.
</p>
<p>
It had been her own suggestion to go to West
Haven High School when her father was summoned
abroad to build a railroad.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s high time I met some nice outdoor
girls, papa,” she had said. “I am afraid of
boarding school girls. They are so different
from you.”
</p>
<p>
Her father had laughed joyfully over this
speech.
</p>
<p>
“I hope there’s not much resemblance between
me and a boarding school girl, my little Billie,”
he said, pinching her cheek.
</p>
<p>
And now the nice open-air girls whom she had
recalled with pleasure after a summer spent in
West Haven had not come near enough even to
greet her and she had been obliged to pair off
with seven fashion plates.
</p>
<p>
“It’s perfectly maddening,” she exclaimed to
herself, giving the turf on the campus a savage
little kick. “Nancy and Elinor actually avoid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
meeting my eyes as if I were some one unfit to
know. I wish I had consented to go to boarding
school, after all, instead of coming to Cousin
Helen. I don’t want to belong to a silly society
that does nothing but have afternoon teas. I
want to play basket ball and go on long tramps
with other girls and have picnics. I’m so disappointed,
I could weep aloud.”
</p>
<p>
This was the picture Billie had drawn in her
mind of life at West Haven High School and
here she was an outcast from all the good times
and open air games of the class, simply because
not one of her old friends would come near her.
She long remembered that first day at school as
the loneliest and most wretched of her whole life.
</p>
<p>
Then the last gong sounded and everybody
went home except Billie, who had an appointment
with Miss Gray, the principal. After the interview,
in a rebellious and disconsolate humor,
homesick for her father and disappointed with
the whole world, she cranked up her red car and
whirled away toward the open country.
</p>
<p>
As she sped along the road she passed the
three friends of that summer of years ago, walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
briskly away from town. They did not even
look up as she whirled by and the lump in her
throat grew so big that it resolved itself into a
sob and two hot tears trickled down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps they’re going over to the woods;
just what I would have loved to have done,” wept
the disappointed young girl, whose life had been
a lonely one in spite of her father’s devotion and
constant companionship.
</p>
<p>
She was still drying her eyes when she noticed
some distance ahead a man leap into the road and
wave his arms violently. Billie slowed down and
came to a stop; for at the side of the road another
very ill-looking man was lying prone on his back
with closed eyes and slightly parted lips.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” she asked. “Has your friend
been hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“No, miss,” answered the man who had
stopped her, “but he has walked fifteen miles to-day
and I am afraid he’s about all in. I am trying
to get him to his house, but I can’t carry
him and he can’t take another step.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is his house?” asked Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Are you familiar with these parts, miss?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” she answered.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just up that lane about a mile. Only a
matter of five minutes to you.”
</p>
<p>
“Can you get him into the car?” asked Billie,
noticing that this rather sinister looking stranger
had only one arm; also that his right eye was
out and there was a long scar across his upper
lip.
</p>
<p>
“Easily,” he replied, and without another word
he expeditiously supported his friend to the motor
car and lifted him into the back seat.
</p>
<p>
“Poor fellow,” exclaimed Billie sympathetically.
“It’s well I happened along.”
</p>
<p>
The sick man was indeed a wretched looking
object, with a thin, lantern-jawed face, hollow
feverish eyes and a sunken chest. Occasionally
he coughed behind his hands apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“Down the lane, did you say?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, miss, you can just see the house. It’s
the gray one up near the woods.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have him there in a few minutes,” she answered,
putting on all speed.
</p>
<p>
The little machine flew along the hard sandy
road like a redbird on the wing. Billie occasionally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
glanced over her shoulder at the sick man
and each time her eyes met his, which seemed to
burn like coals of fire. She had not liked the
looks of the other man. His one remaining eye
was much too close to his hooked nose; but the
sick man appealed to her sympathies. Billie’s
nature was not a suspicious one. She had encountered
many people in her life, and it is only
people who have lived out of the world who are
apt to suspect strangers.
</p>
<p>
As she drew up the car in front of what appeared
to be a very old, long-deserted fisherman’s
house and turned to see her passengers alight,
she found the one-eyed man bending over his
companion.
</p>
<p>
“He’s fainted, miss,” he said. “If you’ll go
around back of the house to the old well and
draw up a pail of cold water, I guess we can revive
him. Just let down the pail by the wheel
at the side—you’ll see the handle,—and then
get a glass or pitcher or something ’round there
in the shed.”
</p>
<p>
As the man was apparently very busy loosening
the neck-band of his friend’s shirt, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
seemed nothing else for Billie to do but to obey
his directions. In fact, her sympathies were so
deeply aroused that she was more than eager
to help.
</p>
<p>
She dashed around the corner in an instant,
rushed to the old well, and exerting her strength
turned the handle of the rusty wheel around and
around while the rattling chain lowered the moss-covered
bucket deeper and deeper until it struck
the water. Waiting only until the bucket was
filled, she began to raise it as rapidly as she could,
but her muscles were sorely tried by the stubbornness
of the rusty wheel and the additional
weight of the water.
</p>
<p>
The thought of the exhausted man spurred her
on, however, and at length, flushed and perspiring,
she succeeded in drawing the bucket to a
little shelf where she left it while she searched
for a receptacle in which to carry the water.
She found no difficulty in pushing open a loosely-hung
door at the end of the shed, and, after groping
around a moment or two in the semi-darkness,
she discovered a battered tin pail. Hastening back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
with it, she rinsed and filled it, and hurried
around to the front of the house.
</p>
<p>
As she turned the corner, she stopped short!
Where were the two men? Where was her machine?
<em>Where—was—her—machine?</em>
</p>
<p>
Too dazed to move, Billie stood rooted to the
spot while the water trickled out of a hole in
the pail and made a little pool at her feet.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she gasped, “They must be around
the other corner. They <em>must</em> be!”
</p>
<p>
But they were not!—and then Billie noticed
the tracks in the crushed grass that told the tale.
The motor car had been turned and driven away
up the lane!
</p>
<p>
Billie sank down on the step in front of the
old house almost too spent with her exertions
and her shock to think.
</p>
<p>
Then she flung down the pail and rushed up
the lane as though she would try to catch the
vanished car,—but she stopped as abruptly with
a half laugh.
</p>
<p>
“They may be miles and miles away by this
time,—they had time enough while I was fussing
over that old well. And the chain made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
such a noise and the wheel creaked so, I never
heard another sound!”
</p>
<p>
Billie’s eyes filled with indignant tears as she
began slowly to saunter back to the old house.
She felt somehow impelled to return to the scene
of her loss, perhaps to persuade herself that it
was really so.
</p>
<p>
As she neared the spot where she had last seen
her red car, she noticed a slip of paper blowing
lightly about. Idly she picked it up and glanced
over the words written upon it. Then she stood
still and caught her breath as she realized what
they meant.
</p>
<p>
“Stay here. Tell no one. Back soon.”
</p>
<p>
That was the message that Billie read, and she
did not doubt for a moment that it was intended
for her.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, perhaps you will come back, and perhaps
you won’t,” she said half aloud. “Maybe you
think that I think that you have gone for a doctor.
But I don’t. You are two mean, wicked
men to outwit a girl like that. I’ll never see my
car again!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
Just as Billie uttered this despairing cry, she
heard a distant hail, and then another.
</p>
<p>
“Who is coming now?” she thought. “It’s too
soon to expect my sick (?) passenger and his
one-eyed friend, and anyway I hear no car,——nor
anything else, now,” she added. “Maybe I
imagined it. Oh, I’d like to be a man for about
five minutes! Then they wouldn’t <em>dare</em>!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—FRIENDS IN NEED.</h2>
<p>
“There she goes,” Nancy Brown had exclaimed
as “The Comet,” Billie’s motor, whirled by; “too
proud even to ask her old friends to take a spin.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Nancy,” protested Elinor, “don’t be too
hard on her. Remember, she has not seen any
of us since we were children. Perhaps she’s forgotten
all about us. Besides, I’ve been thinking
that we ought to have done the first speaking.
She was starting right for us when Belle Rogers
stopped her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I tried twice to speak to her,” said
Nancy, “and she wouldn’t look at me. I am afraid
we shall never get a ride in that pretty motor
car, and the only one I was ever in was the
stationary automobile at the tintype place at the
County Fair.”
</p>
<p>
The girls walked on silently for a few moments.
The red motor car had turned a curve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
in the road and was out of sight and the place
seemed very lonely and still. The afternoon
shadows were beginning to lengthen as the sun
moved slowly behind the pine woods, which
formed a dark background against the flat, green
meadows about West Haven.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t imagine why we should be wasting
time about a friend who has forgotten us,” exclaimed
Mary Price, “when Elinor has brought
us out here to tell us some mysterious secret.
Don’t you think it’s about time to begin, Elinor?
It’s getting late and we’ve still a good ways to
go.”
</p>
<p>
“I was just going to,” answered her friend,
“but suppose we take the short cut across the
fields, and I’ll tell you on the way. Two other
people are in the secret, Charlie Clay and Ben
Austen. They have promised to meet us at the
old house. Of course, the whole thing may be of
no importance.”
</p>
<p>
“But what is it?” interrupted Nancy. “You
keep dodging around the bush.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Nancy,” answered Elinor, who had a
calm, placid disposition and never hurried about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
anything, “don’t put your most peculiar characteristic
off on me. You know very well that you
are the one who loves to keep a mystery until
we are all of us nearly bursting with curiosity.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t quarrel, children,” interrupted Mary.
“Remember that members of the Blue Bird Society
are bound over not to quarrel.”
</p>
<p>
“We aren’t quarreling; we’re just discussing.
But do go on, Elinor. I can’t stand the suspense
much longer.”
</p>
<p>
“What I am going to tell you,” said Elinor,
“may be of the vastest importance or it may be
just nothing whatever. At any rate, I didn’t
want to take any chances and it was simple
enough for us to meet the boys out here and see
for ourselves.”
</p>
<p>
“See what, Elinor Butler?” ejaculated Nancy
impatiently. “You always begin at the last of
a story and tell backwards.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor smiled provokingly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s to see how much curiosity you can accumulate
without exploding, Nancy, dear.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy shut her lips tightly. She was determined
now, at any cost, not to speak again until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
Elinor had really started on the story, but how
irritating Elinor could be at times!
</p>
<p>
Mary was never disturbed over these little tiffs
of the two friends which were merely the ups and
downs of the endless conversation that flowed
between them.
</p>
<p>
“This is what happened then, Nancy darling,”
continued Elinor, slipping an arm around her
friend’s waist, while she locked her other arm
through Mary’s. And the three girls hurried on,
too absorbed in their intimate talk to notice the
flash of a scarlet motor car through the high
bushes, which bordered both sides of Boulder
Lane, the name of the road which intercepted the
two meadows.
</p>
<p>
“I was coming across Court House Square late
yesterday afternoon after my music lesson. You
know I have begun to study with the new teacher,
Mme. Alta. Just as I came to the statue of
Thomas Jefferson, I heard some one call very
softly, or rather it was more like a hiss than a
call. I suppose I should have rushed off frightened,
but I am never afraid of people. It’s only
spiders and snakes and bulls that make me shiver.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
So, I didn’t run away, but waited, and I discovered
that the hiss came from around the other
side of the statue and was not meant for me at
all. Even then I should have gone on if I hadn’t
heard some one cry out. I couldn’t understand
the language, but another voice said in English:
‘There are only two boxes left. Take them to
the old house in Boulder Lane to-night and never
keep me waiting this long again.’ Then the other
man said something and the English voice said:
‘You can haul them to-morrow morning. It’ll
be time enough when I get the signal to do the
rest.’ I couldn’t understand what the man answered,
but the English voice said: ‘I’ll kill the
whole crew of Butlers and anybody else who interferes
with me. I’m in a desperate humor and
I won’t be bothered.’ Fortunately they took the
walk that goes to the docks, because they would
certainly have seen me if they had come around
on the other side. But I saw them plainly when
they passed under the electric light. They looked
like seamen.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Kill the whole crew of Butlers,’” repeated
Mary Price. “Does he mean that he is going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
wipe your family off the face of the earth? And
for what?”
</p>
<p>
“That is what I want to find out. It wouldn’t
do any special harm to take a late afternoon stroll
in this direction, if the boys are with us. I didn’t
want to say anything to father about it. He is so
busy, and you know how excitable he is. William
is exactly like father. Edward and mother and
I are the only calm, peaceful members of the family,
and mother’s sick and Edward is at college.
Besides, you know, the man may not have meant
us. The county is full of Butlers, dozens of
them. Some of them claim kin and some do not.
They are the most quarrelsome, high-tempered
people in existence—that is, all except Edward
and me.”
</p>
<p>
The other girls laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Not high-tempered, Elinor,” said Nancy, “but
you have a sort of royal manner when you are
displeased that I imagine a queen might have
when one of her subjects is disobedient.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” interrupted Mary. “I thought
I heard some one call.”
</p>
<p>
The girls paused and listened. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
standing in a broad, flat meadow which seemed to
stretch out indefinitely in one direction like an
enormous pale-green billiard table; but in the
other direction, bordered by alder bushes, lay
Boulder Lane; so called because of an immense
gray boulder, which in some prehistoric upheaval
had been tossed here, and which resembled now
an old gray sentinel standing on perpetual guard.
</p>
<p>
“Why, there’s the automobile,” exclaimed
Nancy, after some minutes, following an occasional
flash of red through the bushes, as the
flying motor car sped on up the lane.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what she is doing up Boulder Lane?
Exploring by herself, I suppose. It must be
lonely,” observed Mary.
</p>
<p>
A fresh salt breeze had sprung up from the
ocean, bringing with it the chill of the oncoming
night. The three girls hastened their footsteps.
If they were late, the boys might not wait for
them.
</p>
<p>
“Boys are so unreliable,” Mary had remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Not Ben Austen,” said Elinor. “Father says
he is as trustworthy as the Bank of England.
But he’s slow. He never likes to stop one thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
until he finishes it, no matter what’s waiting. He
and Charlie are building a boat somewhere down
the beach and they spend all their afternoons
at it, but they are sure to be there if they promised.”
</p>
<p>
By this time the girls had reached the hedge.
It was certainly a lonesome place. The old house
which had been unoccupied for many years because
its last occupant had committed suicide by
hanging himself from a beam, appeared in the
gathering dusk like a solitary gray ghost;
the front windows resembled two large sad eyes
gazing into space and the walls, streaked with
the tempests of many seasons, had the appearance
of a worn, tear-stained face.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me,” whispered Nancy, “I had forgotten
what a weird old place this was. It might be
the entrance to a tomb.”
</p>
<p>
“Halo-o-o!” called a boyish voice, and a tall,
overgrown lad appeared coming up the lane from
the direction of the beach, followed by a much
smaller youth, who was so absorbed with whittling
a little boat that he did not even look up
when the girls answered the call.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t make so much noise, Ben,” said Elinor,
when they had climbed through the hedge and
congregated together in the lane. “This is just
an investigating party. We are not to take any
risks.”
</p>
<p>
“There seems to be nobody around,” replied
Ben. “We saw an automobile go past a little
while ago with two men in it and some big boxes
in the back. It was almost stuck in the sand. I
wonder it could get along at all. It looked like a
big, red lobster.”
</p>
<p>
“Red?” cried the girls in one voice.
</p>
<p>
“I never saw anything redder in my life,” put
in Charlie.
</p>
<p>
“You must be mistaken about the men, then,”
said Elinor decisively. “Because Billie Campbell
owns it and was running it herself a little while
ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we were not close enough to get a good
look, but Billie Campbell appeared to be two men
at that distance. But come along, girls. It is
getting late and we had better not lose any more
time. Now, what is it we are looking for? Butler
bundles and boxes?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think they can be called Butler bundles,”
replied Elinor, “since my family is to be
wiped out of existence if it interferes with the
bundles, whatever they are.”
</p>
<p>
The boys and girls who were thoroughly enjoying
the fun and mystery of the expedition now
advanced on tiptoe to the ghostly looking house,
like a party of conspirators in a play.
</p>
<p>
“I feel like a pirate,” whispered Nancy, giggling.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Ben, who was ahead of the others,
stopped and put his fingers to his lips. He beckoned
to them to follow him around to the side of
the house.
</p>
<p>
“I heard something inside the house,” he said,
in a low voice. “Wait here, girls, with Charlie
while I take a look.”
</p>
<p>
He crept cautiously around to the front and
presently they heard him open the door and walk
boldly in.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going, too,” said Charlie, unable to contain
his curiosity any longer, and the girls followed
him single-file into a low-studded, dusty
room, unfurnished except for one rickety chair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
but behind that stood—Billie Campbell! And
facing Billie in the dim light just inside the door
stood Ben, surprise written as plainly upon his
face as bravery, defiance, and apprehension were
mingled upon hers.
</p>
<p>
The girls were too amazed to speak at first.
</p>
<p>
“Billie Campbell!” cried Nancy, at last. “Did
two men frighten you and run away with your
automobile?”
</p>
<p>
Billie nodded. Somehow it was very difficult to
keep back her tears now that help had come; but
she never had been a cry-baby even as a child and
now she choked down her sobs with all her
strength, for in the gathering dusk she had recognized
the faces of her three childhood friends
who had refused to remember her that day at
school.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but I’m glad to see you!” she exclaimed.
“After the men went off I noticed that the front
door was open and I came in a minute to see if
it really looked as though it were lived in now-a-days
as the man said. But it just looks deserted,
and it’s dreadfully dusty except here in the corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
and from here to the door,—just as though
something had been dragged across the floor.”
</p>
<p>
The young girl had been talking excitedly, but
now she stopped abruptly and with a friendly look
and a gesture of intense relief she stretched her
arms over her head, as though with the relaxation
of her muscles she could also free herself
from the sudden shock and dread that had bound
her.
</p>
<p>
She was tall for her age, fifteen, with a frank,
almost boyish face, fine gray eyes, and a rather
large mouth which curled up at the corners when
she smiled and showed two graduated rows of
strong white teeth. Her light brown hair was
parted in the middle and rolled on each side into
a thick, knobby plait in the back.
</p>
<p>
“She’s not very strong on looks,” thought
Nancy, who set great store on beauty herself,
“but she’s got the nicest face I ever saw.”
</p>
<p>
“How did it happen?” asked Ben.
</p>
<p>
Then Billie told how the two men had duped
her and left her behind the deserted house, and
how she had found the message on the slip of
paper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then the men are coming back?” cried Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” replied Billie, “and we’d better
hurry away from here as fast as we can in case
they come. They may not intend to do me any
harm, but they are a very determined-looking
pair of characters, as papa says, and one of them
has a long pistol and a knife in his belt, for I
saw them.”
</p>
<p>
“But what about the red motor?” demanded
Nancy, whose yearning to ride in the car had
somewhat biased her good judgment.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll just have to lose it, I suppose,” answered
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“I have a scheme,” put in Charlie, who rarely
spoke without due deliberation. “Miss Campbell
is just about as tall as I am—she may be a little
shorter,” he added, stretching himself to his full
height.
</p>
<p>
The others smiled secretly at this, for Billie
was at least an inch taller than Charlie, but they
knew that the most sensitive spot in his nature
was his height, since he was the oldest member of
the party and Ben overtopped him by nearly three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
inches. And Charlie had a sneaking suspicion
that he never would be tall enough. His bones
were small and his frame as slender and delicate
as a girl’s.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose I put on your hat and veil and your
long coat,” he continued, “and sit here on the
step waiting. It’s getting darker all the time,
and so if the men come back they’ll think it is
you; but if they thought somebody was onto them,
they would probably break their word and chase
off with the motor.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think that would be quite fair,” said
Billie. “Suppose they found out you were a boy.
They might shoot you or something.”
</p>
<p>
“But they won’t find it out,” answered Charlie.
“Hurry up. We have no time to lose.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, do,” urged Ben. “It’s much the best
way. We couldn’t leave you for the thieves and
it’s a pity to lose the car. Besides, the rest of us
will hide in the house and if anything happens,
we’ll come to the rescue.”
</p>
<p>
Billie removed her ulster without another
word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“She’s a dandy, sensible girl,” thought Ben to
himself.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better take the skirt, too. If they saw
your trouser legs, it would be all off,” said Billie,
as she unbuckled her belt and removed her gray
walking skirt, standing before them without any
embarrassment in a short, red silk petticoat.
</p>
<p>
“What about shoes?” observed Mary Price.
“Those Charlie is wearing are not much like
a girl’s shoes.”
</p>
<p>
“How about these pumps? I wear No. fives,”
said Billie, calmly kicking off her slippers.
</p>
<p>
Charlie, good-naturedly, unlaced his stout boy’s
boots.
</p>
<p>
“I might be able to get my big toe into them,”
he said. “Like Cinderella’s step-sisters and the
little glass slipper.”
</p>
<p>
“These aren’t any Cinderella’s,” laughed Billie.
</p>
<p>
How nice these boys and girls did seem to her
and how fine it was to be with them, even in this
strange and dangerous situation!
</p>
<p>
Charlie could wear the slippers, however, although
they were somewhat narrow in the toe,
and presently he was fully dressed in a girl’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
suit, with his face almost concealed by a long
gray chiffon veil, twisted around Billie’s gray felt
hat, trimmed with one red wing.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry, they’re really coming,” called Billie,
catching the familiar sound of a motor engine
in the distance.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Ben, who had been hovering
around Charlie in pretended admiration of his
changed appearance. “Good luck, old boy!” he
added as he hastened after the girls up the narrow
flight of stairs into the attic, which was perfectly
dark and seemed a better place for hiding
than outside, where enough twilight still lingered
to make objects plainly visible.
</p>
<p>
“We are a good deal like ‘The Musicians of
Bremen,’” observed Mary, in a low voice, as
they lay stretched face downward on the attic
floor. “Don’t you remember that old fairy tale of
Grimm’s; when the robber came back to the house
in the wood he was bitten and kicked and
scratched and pecked by the dog and the donkey
and the cat and the rooster, and then they set
up such a braying and barking and crowing and
meowing that he ran away scared to death?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“If anything did happen, we might try the
howling part,” said Billie. “I should think a
piercing shriek from a place like this would scare
a brave man——”
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h, they’re almost here,” cautioned Ben.
“Don’t move, any one. The floor will creak.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to sneeze,” hissed Nancy, in the
dark.
</p>
<p>
“Press your upper lip and don’t dare do it,”
whispered Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Shut up, all of you,” said Ben, as the motor
car drew up beside the hedge at one side of
the house.
</p>
<p>
“If there is any shrieking to be done,” added
Mary, “I’ll do it. I’m the best shrieker in the
sophomore class. I know how to do it in the top
of my head——”
</p>
<p>
“Sh-h-h!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—THE MUSICIANS OF BREMEN.</h2>
<p>
Nancy could not keep from trembling slightly
as she heard the car panting at a little distance
and realized that perhaps a moment of real danger
was near, in spite of their joking. Elinor,
too, felt very much like giving away to a few
tremors, but she reproached herself for such weak
behavior and held her body as rigid as a stone
image while she said sternly in her mind:
</p>
<p>
“My knees are not at all weak. It’s only the
position I am lying in that makes them feel
queer.”
</p>
<p>
A sound as though a heavy foot had been
placed on the step outside was heard and then a
voice which Billie recognized as that of the one-eyed
man said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, young lady, I suppose you have had
about enough of this? We have kept our word,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
you see, which I judge you found on the paper,
as you are still here.”
</p>
<p>
There was a short silence. Evidently Charlie
nodded assent to the supposition and the motion
gave full satisfaction, for the voice went on,
“Has any one been around, miss? You didn’t
hear the sound of any voices, did you, while we
were gone? We saw some people in the field as
we left. Did they come this way? Speak up,
miss.”
</p>
<p>
Not a heart on the attic floor but thumped as
the one-eyed man asked these questions. They
had never thought of Charlie’s voice, which was
about as deep as a full grown man’s!
</p>
<p>
A perfectly death-like stillness reigned for a
moment. It was plain that Charlie was not going
to trust his voice.
</p>
<p>
“Do not be frightened, Señorita,” put in the
thin man. “You may speak without fear. Do
not weep. Perhaps she did see something. It
was not the ghost of the dead man who hanged
himself in here, was it?” he added in a low
voice.
</p>
<p>
“Hold your tongue,” said the other man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
“Speak up, young woman. Have you no voice
left? You’ll not have strength enough to run the
car if you go on like this.”
</p>
<p>
A deep sob reached the ears of the listeners
overhead.
</p>
<p>
Then the alarming thought came to Ben: How
was Charlie to run the motor car in case the men
insisted on his leaving first? Plainly, it was necessary
to get rid of these men somehow. Then
they would all make a dash, and he would crank
up while Billie jumped in and started the car.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to hear the sound of your voice before
I go,” insisted the one-eyed man. “I want
to hear you give me your sacred word of honor to
keep this little loan of your car a secret. If we
find that you have told, and we’ll know it if you
have, you and your family will regret it, that’s
all. We know how to take our revenge, don’t we,
Pedro? So speak up, young woman, and say the
words. I promise——”
</p>
<p>
Another deep sob.
</p>
<p>
“Come, come. Hold up your head and let me
see your face. Say, Pedro, look here; it doesn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
seem quite the same as it did half an hour ago,
somehow. Strike a light!”
</p>
<p>
There was great but noiseless commotion in the
attic! What if the men should lift Charlie’s
veil!
</p>
<p>
Since Mary had mentioned “The Musicians of
Bremen” an idea had been forming in Ben’s mind
and he now hastily communicated it in a low
whisper to his neighbor who passed it quickly
down the line.
</p>
<p>
Just as the thin man outside exclaimed in a
high sharp tone, “Why, it’s a boy!” Ben whispered,
“Ready!”
</p>
<p>
Immediately the attic was filled with a pandemonium
of noise,—the barking of a dog, cries,
and screams! It was a truly terrifying combination,
Mary’s shrill shriek rising weirdly above
the other sounds as though from one in mortal
agony.
</p>
<p>
The two men outside were startled in spite of
themselves and dashed away on an uncontrollable
impulse, the thin man shouting, “The ghost
of the dead man! His evil spirit haunts us!”
</p>
<p>
“Good work, Ben,” called Charlie softly, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
a moment. “Come out, quick! They’ve gone
around back of the house. You can come this
way, but hurry!”
</p>
<p>
The adventure had been so exciting and was
so quickly over that the girls hardly realized
where they were when they found themselves
in front of the house, standing in a half-bewildered
group in the deepening twilight.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody shall take any more chances for my
motor car,” whispered Billie. “You have all
risked your lives enough as it is, and I’m deeply
grateful. The men may be around there by the
machine, so let’s make a break for the fields and
go straight home.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied Ben stoutly; “it would be best
for you girls to get away, but Charlie and I will
finish the job. Those fellows are cowards, any
way, and——”
</p>
<p>
“But you can’t run the car,” said Billie, rapidly
putting on her things, which Charlie had
discarded with a sigh of relief. “I’ll have to stay.
The other girls must go, though.”
</p>
<p>
The discussion, however, was ended by
Charlie, who had skipped off to reconnoiter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
now appeared running at full speed around the
side of the house.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, let’s all go,” he said. “They’ve
gone, but they might come back.”
</p>
<p>
Without a word, the others followed him and
jumped into the car, while Ben, who knew a little
about motors, began to crank up the machine.
Suddenly a voice spoke out of the darkness:
</p>
<p>
“This looks like a nice little party. Get out of
that car, every one of you, or I’ll shoot,” and
the sinister looking one-armed man, who appeared
to have sprung up from the earth, stood at
the side of the automobile with his pistol pointed
straight at Billie. “Did you imagine,” he continued,
“that a parcel of children could fool a
man like me?”
</p>
<p>
There was no reply to the question. Mary and
Nancy were so limp with fear they could not
have lifted a little finger if there had been a dozen
pistols pointing at them. Elinor might have
slipped a ramrod down her back, so stiffly and
proudly did she hold herself in that fearful moment.
Billie had turned white as a sheet, but she
still had strength enough left to make a move to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
get out when Ben, whose stubborn nature would
not even now give up the fight, raised his overgrown,
boyish figure from the ground where he
had been kneeling, and with a quick motion
pressed a piece of glittering steel to the man’s
forehead.
</p>
<p>
“Drop that pistol, or you’re a dead man,” he
said in the deepest chest tones he could produce.
His voice was still in the tenor stage.
</p>
<p>
Not even a gentleman of fortune who had lost
an eye and an arm in past dangerous adventures
could quite keep from shrinking at this extremely
unpleasant sensation produced by cold steel
against his face, and without a word of protest
he dropped the pistol in the road.
</p>
<p>
“Now, back off,” said Ben, “and don’t stop
until you get as far as that tree over there.”
</p>
<p>
The man retreated, cursing under his breath,
and in another instant they were off in the dark.
</p>
<p>
“We forgot to pick up his pistol,” exclaimed
Charlie, as three shots rang out in quick succession.
</p>
<p>
“But Ben has one,” said Billie, feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
somehow that she had known these nice brave boys for
a long time, instead of three-quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>
“That was only a monkey wrench,” answered
Charlie, laughing.
</p>
<p>
And Billie was moved with admiration and respect
for the slow-speaking, quiet boy, who had
twice in so short a time outwitted two very dangerous
and experienced adventurers.
</p>
<p>
It was a splendid ride in the darkness. The
fresh salt air swept their faces and set their
blood to tingling with a new enjoyment. They
had just been through a most dangerous and exciting
experience, these young people, and Nancy
and Mary were not ashamed to admit that
they at least had been very much frightened.
But people who have lived always by the sea are
used to looking danger calmly in the face.
</p>
<p>
Half a mile beyond the quiet little harbor of
West Haven a lighthouse stood on a small, rocky
promontory, and from the shore on a calm day
could be seen rows of sharp-pointed rocks thrust
out of the water like great black teeth waiting to
devour any chance ship which might be blown
against them. In bad weather the water about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
the Black Reefs, as they were called, was lashed
and churned into fury and sometimes after a
great storm groups of people might be seen hurrying
up the cliff path to the life-saving station,
while out in the ocean, stuck fast to the teeth of
the Black Reefs was a pretty three-masted
schooner, perhaps, or a stained and scarred old
freight ship, looking very small and helpless in
its terrible plight.
</p>
<p>
Billie, herself, was the only person in the motor
car who had not seen a shipwreck on the
Black Reefs. She had never even seen one of the
September storms when the sea rolled itself into
mountainous waves and dashed against the cliffs
of West Haven.
</p>
<p>
As they neared the town, Billie slowed down
the motor and turned to speak to her new friends.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t even try to thank all of you for what
you have done for me, but I want to tell you that
I think you are the bravest, nicest boys and girls
in the whole world, and it was just to be with you
that I came back to West Haven to go to school.
I was very unhappy to-day because I was afraid
that Nancy and Mary and Elinor had forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
me and the splendid times we had together one
summer when I was a little girl——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Billie, we hadn’t forgotten you,” broke
in Nancy. “We thought when you joined Belle
Rogers’ crowd that you——”
</p>
<p>
“But I didn’t join them,” Billie interrupted,
laughing. “They kidnapped me and never let me
out of their sight the whole time. I had almost
made up my mind to write to papa to let me go
to boarding school, after all. I wanted to know
some real girls. I have never had a chance before,
you know, and when I talked it over with
papa, we decided that all of you were the nicest
real girls we had ever known, and I just thought
I would spend the winter with Cousin Helen and
meet you again, while papa was in Russia.”
</p>
<p>
The three girls blushed with pleasure at this
gratifying compliment.
</p>
<p>
“We were just as glad to see you, too, Billie,”
said Elinor. “It was all a foolish mistake. But
we shall be friends now, and you must join the
Blue Birds. It’s the Sophomore Club, and we
have lots of fun.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, I’d love to,” answered Billie, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
gratefully and modestly as if she had been paid
the highest honor in the land. “I’ve been thinking,”
she added, “that we’d better keep all this
business about these men secret. You know
Cousin Helen; if she hears about it, we’ll probably
have to store the motor car. She’ll never let
me out of her sight again.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll keep it secret,” cried the others in a
chorus.
</p>
<p>
So this very sensational adventure, which
would certainly have spread like wildfire through
the town of West Haven once it got out, remained
a profound secret.
</p>
<p>
Some good came of it, however, since it served
to unite four old friends. But we have not seen
the last of the mysterious individuals who borrowed
Billie’s motor car.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—PLOTS AND PLANS.</h2>
<p>
Belle Rogers was not always the bewitchingly
pretty, dimpling, smiling young girl who had endeavored
to annex Billie.
</p>
<p>
And when she was not pretty, Belle’s friends
liked to keep well out of her vicinity. At such
times two little white dents appeared on each
side of her nose. Her large, china blue eyes
were transformed into wells of steely gray and
the smiling, baby mouth became two narrow
white lips. All the color left her cheeks, and people
who did not know her would exclaim:
</p>
<p>
“How faded and ill she looks!”
</p>
<p>
When Belle looked like this she was unusually
quiet at first, but it was the quiet which comes before
a tornado, and it was only when the storm
burst that those unfamiliar with her ways realized
that Belle had been very, very angry.
</p>
<p>
This is what happened on the day after the exciting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
experience in Boulder Lane, and all because
Wilhelmina Campbell, true to her old
friends, the “Blue Birds,” after being formally
invited, had positively declined to join the “Mystic
Seven.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry,” she said, trying her best to be
cordial, “but, you see, the others had first claim
on me because I have known them a long time and
I have already promised to become a Blue Bird.”
</p>
<p>
“We asked you first,” exclaimed Belle, in a
preternaturally quiet tone of voice.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why that should make any difference,”
answered Billie, feeling very uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
“It makes a great deal of difference,” answered
Belle, who was always gifted with a flow
of words in the moments of her greatest anger.
“You are probably not familiar with the ways of
schools and school societies. I understand you
have never been to school before.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I have. I went to school in Paris
for three months and to another in Dresden for
a whole winter.”
</p>
<p>
“This is America,” went on Belle, in a slow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
even tone, taking no other notice of the interruption,
“and if you decline the honor we have
paid you in the sophomore year, you will not only
be blackballed in our societies the other two years,
but you will not receive any invitations from me
and my friends to our parties now or ever, and
you will be obliged to associate with the commonest
and most ordinary girls in West Haven.
The children of cooks——”
</p>
<p>
“Mary Price,” thought Billie. Mrs. Price had
a tea room.
</p>
<p>
“The daughters of seamen——”
</p>
<p>
“Nancy!” said Billie out loud. Nancy’s father
was a sea captain.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Nancy Brown,” continued Belle, growing
angrier every moment. “You will simply be
an outcast in West Haven, and I advise you to
think the matter over well before you decide to
join that low, common crowd, for I assure you
it will be the last of you with us——”
</p>
<p>
Billie was so aghast at the insolence of the
spoiled girl that she did not attempt to interrupt
the rush of words which seemed to flow from her
lips without any effort whatever. She was very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
angry herself, as a matter of fact, but with the
self-control she had learned from her father, she
determined to hold her peace until Belle had run
down, as she expressed it later to the other girls.
</p>
<p>
At last there came a pause, and Billie, who
had been sitting on the window ledge in the gymnasium
swinging her feet and thinking of what
she was going to say when she was entirely prepared
to speak, slipped down to the floor and
stood before the enraged girl like a brave soldier
in the face of battle.
</p>
<p>
But this was all she said, for Billie was really
very much like a boy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it is any honor to join your club,
or go with you and your friends. I wouldn’t give
up Mary and Nancy and Elinor for twenty Mystic
Sevens. I’d rather go to boarding school any
day, and that’s about the worst fate that could
happen to me.”
</p>
<p>
Then she turned on her heel and walked away,
leaving Belle in the grip of a tempest of sobs and
tears. Such rages are quite like the West Indian
storms which sweep up the coast with a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
blowing of wind and then, after a tremendous
roar of thunder, the downpour follows.
</p>
<p>
That night in her pretty chintz-hung bedroom
in the beautiful Rogers house, which was one of
the show places of West Haven, Belle Rogers
planned her revenge. Her temples were throbbing
and her whole body ached with exhaustion.
Tempers are really quite as devastating to the
system as the West Indian tornadoes are to the
country over which they sweep.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get even with that rough tom-boy,” she
said out loud. “I’ll pay her back if it takes
all winter to do it. I’ll make her sorry she ever
came to West Haven, and I’ll make the others
pay, too. They’ll see what it means to interfere
with me and my plans. Perhaps papa will give
me a motor car, only I’m afraid of the things,
and I never could run one. My hands are much
too small and delicate to handle machinery.”
</p>
<p>
“Belle, darling, do you feel any better?” asked
Mrs. Rogers, anxiously, outside the door.
</p>
<p>
Belle made no reply. It was her custom to
pretend to be asleep when she wished to be alone,
and she wished now to spend a long uninterrupted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
evening to herself, for her thoughts were very
busy. A plan had come into her head. It had
sprung up suddenly, full-grown, as if it had been
secretly hatching in the bottom of her mind for a
long time and now appeared a matured scheme.
</p>
<p>
Her blood tingled at the notion. It was such
an audacious, daring thing that the very thought
made her dizzy.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do it,” she said at last, her mind made
up. “I’ll do it, and I’ll get only one person to
help me, because it will take two to work it. Now,
who shall that person be? It would be best to
ask a Blue Bird, but which one?”
</p>
<p>
Her thoughts ran over the girls in the despised
society, but there was only one of the ten whom
she would quite dare to approach. The others
were fiercely loyal to each other.
</p>
<p>
This possible traitor was a new girl in West
Haven. Her name was Francesca Alta, but her
friends called her Fannie. She was the daughter
of Mme. Alta, a music teacher lately established
in the town. Many of the girls were taking
music lessons of Mme. Alta, and Belle, who
was one of her pupils, often had opportunities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
of speaking to the little dark-haired daughter,
although she had only nodded to her coldly so far.
</p>
<p>
“I will speak to her to-morrow,” she exclaimed,
as she swallowed the sleeping powder her indulgent
mother always gave her after one of these
violent headaches.
</p>
<p>
In the morning Belle had regained her baby
smile. The red had left her nose and was now in
its proper spots on her round, plump cheeks.
Once more her large blue eyes looked appealingly
into the eyes of those she honored with her
glances. Belle never saw what she preferred to
ignore, and one of the most delightful sights of
that bright September morning was a red motor
car filled with pretty young girls, which whirled
into the High School grounds, making a bright
splash of scarlet against the old gray walls of the
building.
</p>
<p>
Belle did not see the “Comet” and its load, or
would not see it, but later, Billie, who never bore
malice, bowed a cheerful good morning to her
enemy, and, to the surprise of the others, received
a cordial bow in return.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry I was cross to you yesterday, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
Campbell. Will you forgive me?” Belle asked
her.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed,” answered the warm-hearted
young girl. “It’s awfully nice of you to admit
it,” and she secretly decided that the others were
rather hard on Belle Rogers, after all.
</p>
<p>
However, when the girls heard of the apology,
they were skeptical.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the ‘Comet’ that won her over,” observed
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe it,” answered their new, inseparable
friend, who after two days’ association
was as intimate with the three girls as if she
had known them always, so rapidly do young
girl intimacies grow.
</p>
<p>
“Something does seem to have happened to
her,” said Mary Price. “Perhaps you gave her
such a dressing-down, Billie, that she’s turned
over a new leaf. She would never have stooped
to talk to Fannie Alta before, but she is doing it
now, and look—will wonders never cease?”
</p>
<p>
The two girls were indeed in intimate conversation.
They were walking arm in arm up
and down the campus, nibbling sandwiches. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
West Haven High School the girls either
brought their luncheons with them to eat at recess
or bought sandwiches of that plucky, hard-working
little woman, Mrs. Price, Mary’s mother,
who made the sandwiches and brought them to
the school herself in a big basket.
</p>
<p>
That is why Mary Price had exclaimed, “Will
wonders never cease?” She had recognized
the package of sandwiches in oil paper, which
Belle Rogers must have bought from her mother,
and which she was now sharing with dark,
shabby little Fannie Alta.
</p>
<p>
“She used to say she would rather starve than
eat one of mother’s lettuce sandwiches,” Mary
exclaimed, “but she appears even to have come to
that.”
</p>
<p>
“If this is one of your mother’s own, it’s very
delicious,” exclaimed Billie, gallantly turning the
conversation into other channels. After all, it
was just as well not to form the habit of discussing
Belle too much. Her father had never approved
of criticising people.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t lead to anything but bilious headaches,”
he used to say. “Sick, bilious headaches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
and a very yellow complexion. Critical people always
look like that, Billie, my girl.”
</p>
<p>
Billie’s complexion was clear and healthy. She
had never had a bilious headache in her life. But,
then, she was not given to picking flaws in other
people’s characters.
</p>
<p>
However, the novelty of the richest and proudest
girl in West Haven making friends with a
poor music teacher’s daughter was soon to be
eclipsed by a much more sensational and mysterious
incident.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon, after school, when the four
friends assembled in the carriage shed for their
usual spin home in Billie’s motor car, they found
a note stuck conspicuously between the cushion
and the back of the seat. It was addressed in a
large angular hand to “Miss Wilhelmina Campbell
and her friends, both boys and girls, especially
Miss Butler,” and inside it read:
</p>
<p>
“Keep quiet about Boulder Lane. You are
watched and if you let a word slip out, the punishment
will come quickly.”
</p>
<p>
“How ridiculous,” exclaimed Billie angrily,
when she had shown the note to the others. “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
have a great mind to write papa all about it, only
it would worry him to death. It is only cowards
who write anonymous letters, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
But she did not write to her father, and the
other girls, too, were silent on the matter.
</p>
<p>
They wondered many times who had put the
note on the seat. Strangers were not unusual in
West Haven, where sailors and seamen often
came ashore, but the Girls’ High School was at
the other end of town and visitors ashore seldom
strayed so far away from the shops and the little
theatre.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know what their grudge is against
the Butler family,” Elinor had demanded, but no
one could answer the question, and she was still
determined not to disturb her highly excitable
father.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—THE FIRST MOTOR PICNIC.</h2>
<p>
One Saturday morning early in September
Miss Helen Campbell gave a breakfast party to
her four favorite Blue Birds. It was to be the
beginning of an eventful day for the young girls,
three of whom were to take their first long motor
trip, and, furthermore, the motor party was
to end with a visit to Shell Island, where this
excited and happy company of young people
were to spend the night, motoring back to West
Haven next day.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell herself was excited.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a novelty for me, my dears,” she exclaimed,
beaming on her guests from behind the
silver urn at the head of the breakfast table.
“I’m a very dull, lonesome old woman, and having
this nice child here with me is going to wake
me into life again. I shall never be able to give
you up, Wilhelmina. You had better write your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
father that you have been adopted by a very obstinate
old party, who believes that possession is
nine points of the law.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m quite willing to be possessed, Cousin
Helen,” answered Billie. “If I could only see
papa sometimes, I think I could say that I never
was so gloriously happy in all my life.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell smiled with pleasure and the
girls thought they had never seen her look more
beautiful. Her white hair glistened like a bank
of snow in the sunshine and her soft eyes were as
blue as patches of West Haven Bay on a clear,
still morning in summer.
</p>
<p>
There were times when the lonely spinster
looked faded and worn, and at such times she
used to shut herself up in her big gray stone
house on Cliff Street and refuse to see even her
most intimate friends.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just one of my lonesome moods,” she used
to say, “and I would not for worlds inflict myself
on innocent people when one is on me.”
</p>
<p>
But Miss Campbell had not had a single attack
of loneliness since Billie had come to live with
her. The vigorous, active young girl had awakened the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
entire household which had run on its
steady even course for so many years, and now
the place hardly recognized itself, filled with the
happy voices and gay laughter of Billie and her
friends.
</p>
<p>
It was an unusual sight for the big mahogany
table in the dining room to be loaded with the
best cut glass and silver and adorned with delicate
lace doilies, which had belonged to Miss
Campbell’s grandmother. These thing had been
laid away for many years. In the centre of the
table was a crystal vase filled with forget-me-nots.
</p>
<p>
“They are the only flowers I could think of
which were the color of your blue birds,” Miss
Campbell had explained. “Besides, they are my
favorite color. You know, I always wear blue
when I don’t wear gray. Sometimes I wear
black——”
</p>
<p>
“Black, Cousin Helen?” repeated Billie. “I
didn’t know you ever wore anything so mournful.”
</p>
<p>
“You shall never see me in it, child, if I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
help it. But I have a black dress, only one, and
I do wear it at times in my bedroom.”
</p>
<p>
Some thirty years before Miss Campbell, then
a young and beautiful girl, had come to West
Haven to live with her grandfather and there she
had lived ever since, except for an occasional
trip abroad. It was supposed that she had suffered
a great sorrow at some time in her life, but
the real story had never been known. Captain
Campbell, her grandfather, had been a jovial,
pleasure loving old man, fond of company and
entertaining. He liked to have his beautiful
granddaughter stand at his side and receive his
guests in a brocaded ball gown, with the famous
Campbell diamonds blazing in her hair and the
diamond and sapphire necklace around her throat.
</p>
<p>
But after General Campbell’s death there were
no more balls and dinners in the big, old house.
The long parlors were seldom opened except to
be cleaned and aired, and Miss Campbell, now a
somewhat shrivelled pink and white little lady of
fifty-five, interested herself only in the charities
of West Haven.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my dear children, this household and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
mistress have got into such a lethargy that it
is time they were waked up. We have been sunk
in so deep a rut, my old servants and I, that it
might have closed over our heads and the world
gone on just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“Lots of poor families would have gone begging
at Christmas, then, Miss Campbell,” put in
Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“And what would all those poor old seamen
have done?” went on Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“And the Blue Birds,” added Mary Price.
“We should have had to use a corner of the
gymnasium at school for our most secret society
meetings.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell paid the rent of the Blue Bird
club rooms.
</p>
<p>
“And, pray, what should I have done?” finished
Billie. “I should have been knocking around still
with papa, trying to get on with the queer people
who live in hotels, and never have had nice girls
to go with or a delightful home to stay in.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell blushed with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“I have a great many surprises up my sleeve
for my little Motor Maids. I shall only tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
one, though. What would you say to a Blue Bird
Thanksgiving ball?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh, oh! How splendid!” cried the young
girls.
</p>
<p>
“Honk, honk!” went the motor horn at the
front entrance, which was a signal for breakfast
to come to an end and the party to be off.
</p>
<p>
A hamper of luncheon had been strapped behind
the car with the suit cases. Miss Campbell
sat between Elinor and Mary in the back, while
Nancy took the seat now understood to be hers
always, beside her friend Billie, in front. The
four Campbell servants, who had grown old in
their mistress’s service, stood in a row on the
gravel walk to witness the strange sight of their
beloved “Miss Helen” sailing away in a red infernal
machine, her blue automobile veil streaming
out behind like a piece of flying cloud.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go too fast, Billie,” she exclaimed, as
they turned the corner of Cliff Street, and whirled
down the steep, rather slippery Main street of
West Haven. “Remember that you have got a
decrepit old woman in the back who has never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
ridden behind anything faster than a pair of
ambling carriage horses in all her life.”
</p>
<p>
“How about the five-thirty express, Cousin
Helen?” Billie called over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“A locomotive with an engineer is a very different
thing from a young girl guiding a scarlet
comet,” the little lady answered; but as they
left the street for the country road and Billie
gradually increased the speed, Miss Campbell
leaned back with a look of blissful enjoyment on
her face.
</p>
<p>
“It is one of the most exhilarating things I
have ever experienced,” she confided to Elinor.
</p>
<p>
At noon they stopped for lunch. The road now
lay along a high cliff overlooking the ocean,
which on this calm September morning was as
serenely blue and still as a mill pond. White sails
dotted it here and there, and an occasional wave
rippled on the pebbly beach with a murmuring,
drowsy sound.
</p>
<p>
They had pulled up at the side of a little pine
grove just off the road and spread the lunch cloth
on a carpet of pine needles.
</p>
<p>
Then the delicious cakes and sandwiches which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
Miss Campbell had ordered from Mrs. Price were
arranged in neat piles, while Elinor opened her
tea basket, a present from an aunt in Ireland, and
made tea for the company.
</p>
<p>
It was all very delightful and they were enjoying
themselves thoroughly, when Billie and
Nancy, who were seated facing the others, received
a slight shock. A tall, slender woman,
dressed in black, with a long black chiffon veil
completely concealing her face, suddenly emerged
from behind a clump of dwarf oak and bay trees
at the far end of the grove and beckoned to them.
</p>
<p>
The two girls exchanged glances of amazement
and Nancy was about to say: “Why, look at that
woman!” when the woman, herself, put her finger
to her lips and shook her head violently.
</p>
<p>
“I think she’s crazy, Nancy,” said Billie, in a
low voice, under cover of the conversation of the
others. “We had better not take any notice. It
would just alarm Cousin Helen and spoil the
day.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy agreed with her, and the two girls were
about to suggest that they start on again, when
the woman began making the most extraordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
motions of entreaty, imploring them with outstretched
arms, beseeching them with every gesture
to come to her. And still the two girls hung
back. Then the woman raised the sleeve of her
loose black silk wrap and showed her arm bound
with a bloody handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
Nancy gasped at this. The sight of blood was
always sickening to her. But, seeing Billie’s
meaning glance in Miss Campbell’s direction, she
pretended that she had choked on her tea.
</p>
<p>
The other three were deep in a conversation.
Miss Campbell was describing a beautiful ball
she had once been to where she had danced with a
real prince, and they hardly noticed when Nancy
and Billie strolled over to the clump of bushes.
</p>
<p>
The woman, who had been waiting for them,
seized Billie’s arm and in a low, rapid voice said:
</p>
<p>
“I see that you are both unusually nice girls
whom I can trust. I am in great trouble. You
will help me, will you not? It is very simple,
what I am going to ask you. You see, I have
been in a wreck.”
</p>
<p>
“A motor wreck?” asked Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes,” replied the woman, not impatiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
but as if she were very much pressed for time.
“The car rolled over the embankment. You will
see it below there. It happened just in the curve
of the road. There was no excuse except that we
were going too fast and the wheels did—what is
it you call it? Skidded? We saved ourselves,
all three, by jumping. Fortunately the back
wheels were caught in the sand and there was just
time to climb out as the car was overturned. The
others have left me. They will return at any moment
now with another car. Hidden under the
seat of the wrecked car is a small box. I must
have it. I must indeed. I cannot get it myself.
I have sprained my knee, and can stand only
by supporting myself against this tree. Will you
get that box for me and place me in your debt
always, always? You cannot understand how important
it is for me to have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we will,” Billie assured her, “and
won’t you let us help you over to our party, or
make you comfortable here with the cushions
until your friends come back?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no,” replied the stranger. “I do not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
wish to be seen if possible. I only beg you to
make haste. I will wait here.”
</p>
<p>
As the woman grew more in earnest, her voice
seemed to deepen and vibrate like a musical instrument,
and the girls almost forgot to listen to
her words under the spell of its wonderful tones;
and when she threw back her veil, they still stood
rooted to the spot, for she was really quite the
most beautiful person they had either of them
ever seen. Her eyes and hair were dark, her
skin rather creamy in texture; there was a generous
curve to her lips, a straight nose and full,
rounded chin. She smiled a little as she noticed
the admiration of the two girls, showing two
rows of white, even teeth.
</p>
<p>
“You will not refuse?” she asked again.
</p>
<p>
And they helped her to sit down on the ground
and hurried out of the grove to the roadside.
There, sure enough, lying on its side in the sand,
some forty feet below the road, was the wrecked
motor car.
</p>
<p>
“Nancy, I would do anything for her,” observed Billie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
as they clambered down the embankment.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she perfect?” exclaimed Nancy. “And
still, Billie, I can’t help believing that she’s
slightly off in her upper story. She was so
queer. But a shock like that would be enough to
turn anybody delirious, jumping out of an automobile
as it turned over an embankment.”
</p>
<p>
“It’ll all depend on whether we find the box.
If it is just a delirious dream, there won’t be any
box and we will have had our climb for nothing.”
</p>
<p>
They searched the upturned car and there was
nothing in it. The ground was strewn with
wreckage. Cushions and rugs were scattered
about in wild confusion. The girls searched the
place hurriedly all the way down to the foot of
the cliff.
</p>
<p>
“There is no need of wasting any more time,
Nancy, dear,” said Billie at last. “It’s very evident
to me that the beautiful lady was out of her
mind and we’ve been ‘stung,’ as the boys say.
Let’s go back. Perhaps she will let us help her
get somewhere.”

<span class='caption'>Half buried in the sand was a small box of highly polished wood.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>
“Yes, I am afraid it’s just a case of King
George’s men marched up the hill and then
marched down again,” said Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“And I got two grass stains when I fell down
just now,” added Billie, looking ruefully at her
white serge skirt.
</p>
<p>
“My shoes are full of sand, and I’ve soiled my
white stockings,” went on Nancy. “Look,” she
cried suddenly; “look, Billie, here it is right under
our noses. I suppose that little bay tree hid it
from us on our way down. I ask the beautiful
lady’s pardon; but I still can’t imagine why her
own friends couldn’t have got it for her just as
well as we could.”
</p>
<p>
Half buried in the sand was a small box of
highly polished wood, six or eight inches square.
Two broad bands of silver reinforced it at the
back and sides, and a little silver combination
lock took the place of the keyhole. In the middle
of the box was a small, round silver plate, on
which a coat of arms was engraved.
</p>
<p>
“This is the box, all right enough,” said Billie,
examining it with much curiosity. “Now let’s return
it to that mysterious lovely person and go
on our ways, rejoicing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
But they were not destined to get rid of the
box that day nor for many another day. Just as
they reached the top of the cliff they heard the
whirring of a motor engine. A car was just
starting from the grove. Two men were on the
front seat, while the owner of the box was lying
almost helplessly in the back seat, her veil thrown
back and her face white and drawn. There was
no top to the car and the girls could see her
plainly. They thought she must have fainted,
but when Nancy called: “Wait, please wait,”
she raised herself quickly, put her finger to her
lips in token of silence and dropped a card into
the road.
</p>
<p>
The next instant the strange motor car was
lost to sight around the curve. Billie picked up
the card with some irritation.
</p>
<p>
“How silly,” she exclaimed, “What are we to
do with this thing? Why couldn’t she have
waited a minute?”
</p>
<p>
“Because she didn’t want the men to know she
had the box, goosey,” answered Nancy. “It’s as
plain as the nose on your face. What does the
card say?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
It was a man’s business card and read:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pierre Lafitte, Avocat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rue——21. Paris.”<br />
</p>
<p>
On the back of the card had been painfully
written with a pencil:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“I knew when you were gone so long that you
would be too late. If you are merciful and kind,
keep the box a secret from all the world. You
will not regret it. Send your name to this address
and you shall be relieved at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Burdened with another secret,” cried Billie, in
a resigned voice. “Where can we hide the
thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll sit on it for the time being,” answered
Nancy, laughing. “There come the girls.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you two infants up to?” called
Elinor, appearing just then at the edge of the
grove. “We thought you had gone in the other
direction and we’ve been looking everywhere for
you.”
</p>
<p>
“We have—er——” hesitated Billie, who never
could tell fibs. “What have we been doing,
Nancy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been looking at a wreck. Don’t you
want to see it?”
</p>
<p>
“Nancy Brown,” cried her friend Mary, putting
her hands on Nancy’s shoulders and gazing
into her face, “you’ve got a secret. I can tell by
your expression. You are hiding something.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m trying to hide it, but I find it rather difficult.
I feel like a bantam hen sitting on a goose
egg.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s push her off her goose egg,” cried Elinor,
“and see what it really is.”
</p>
<p>
“Help, Billie, help!” screamed Nancy, while
the four friends engaged in a school girl romp,
and Miss Campbell, who was dozing in the grove,
half opened her eyes and smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Is there anything more charming and sweeter
than the sound of children’s voices out of doors?”
she said to herself. She could never get used
to the idea that Billie was not still the little eight-year-old
girl who had spent a summer in West
Haven seven years before.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the guardian of the box was
well defended by Billie until she began to laugh,
and when Nancy was taken with the giggles her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
father used to say she was nothing but an abandoned
lunatic. The place rang with the joyous
peals and the other girls were obliged to pause in
the struggle and join in. Then this foolishly
happy child rolled helplessly onto the ground,
upsetting the box.
</p>
<p>
But there came a sudden end to the laughter,
for the top of the box had sprung open and its
contents were scattered on the roadside.
</p>
<p>
The girls clasped their hands excitedly and
gazed at each other with wide-eyed amazement,
for at their feet glittered dozens of the most beautiful
jewels. There were a diamond and sapphire
necklace, strings of pearls, earrings, rings,
and broaches.
</p>
<p>
“Great heavens, what have you girls been doing?”
exclaimed Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Nancy, you explain,” answered Billie, grown
very grave, all of a sudden. “I’ll gather these
things up and get them out of sight as quickly
as possible. I think my suit case is the safest
place for the time being, and we can take it into
the front of the car with us. Then we can discuss
later what we had better do.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
While the girls listened to Nancy’s strange
story of the beautiful injured woman, Billie collected
and replaced the jewels in the box with the
card, and packed it in the bottom of her suit case.
</p>
<p>
In another ten minutes the motor party was on
the road again, the younger members somewhat
sobered by the secret responsibility which had
been thrust upon them.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—THE BOX OF TROUBLES.</h2>
<p>
Shell Island is really only an island in name.
A narrow creek which fills and empties with the
incoming and outgoing tides divides it from the
mainland. A bridge spans this chasm over which
flows a constant stream of motor and driving parties
from all the villages and summer resorts up
and down the coast.
</p>
<p>
Just at sundown, as the “Comet” took the steep
road down the cliff to the bridge, a big touring
car shot past.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear,” exclaimed Nancy, “I did hope we
would leave all care behind when we came away,
and now I am perfectly certain that Belle Rogers
was sitting on the front seat of that automobile.
I suppose she’ll be floating around the ballroom in
blue chiffons this evening.”
</p>
<p>
“Is she a care?” asked Billie, who had a placid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
and rather masculine way of forgetting all about
the people she didn’t like.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t mind her, only she always makes
me feel like a rag picker’s daughter.”
</p>
<p>
“I think she’s over-dressed,” put in Billie. “I
should feel utterly foolish with all that finery and
jewelry on me. When papa and I used to buy
my clothes, he would say: ‘Suppose we stick to
plain white, daughter, and skip the furbelows.
We can’t go very far wrong if we do that, and
if my little daughter begins to put on ruffles and
puffles and falals without anybody’s advice but
mine, I’m afraid she might be taken for a walking
fashion plate and some one will try to stand
her up in a shop window.”
</p>
<p>
Nancy laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I think you have the prettiest dresses I ever
saw, Billie, but I am glad Miss Campbell has persuaded
you to stop dressing so much like a boy.
Lace collars are lots more becoming than those
stiff linen ones.”
</p>
<p>
“They were chokers,” answered Billie, good-naturedly,
as the car drew up at the steps of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
hotel immediately behind the automobile which
had passed it on the road.
</p>
<p>
Belle and her party were waiting on the piazza,
the women in long pongee coats with the very latest
motor bonnets and veils.
</p>
<p>
“Those are her rich friends, the Jordannes,”
whispered Nancy, in awed tones. “They used to
be just plain Jordan before they made so much
money.”
</p>
<p>
“I think Jordan is a much nicer name. It has
such a fine Oriental sound, ‘Where rolls the River
Jordan.’”
</p>
<p>
By this time several porters from the hotel had
stepped to the motor car door and assisted Miss
Campbell, somewhat stiff from the long ride, to
alight. The girls jumped nimbly out after her
and their luggage was unstrapped and piled on
the ground near the Jordanne luggage. But Billie
was careful to keep a firm hold on her own suit
case with its precious load.
</p>
<p>
“Let the man take your bag, dear,” called Miss
Campbell. “You will strain your back carrying
that heavy thing.”
</p>
<p>
There was nothing for Billie to do but resign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
the suit case, although she tried to keep an eye
on it as they followed the porter through the
lobby to the elevator. Miss Campbell had telegraphed
ahead for rooms.
</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, there was another elevator
for luggage, and the bag was temporarily
out of Billie’s sight, but her mind was soon at
ease when she saw it stacked with the others in
the bedroom which she and Nancy were to share.
</p>
<p>
“While we dress for dinner,” she observed,
“we’ll have a talk about that jewelry. What on
earth are we going to do with it?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think we’d better tell Miss Campbell?”
suggested Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it would be best, but Cousin Helen
does go off so about things, and I have a feeling
that if she knew it she wouldn’t allow us to keep
our promise to our poor beautiful lady. She
would be sure to turn the box over to the police
or call in a lawyer or something. And if we
could only keep the box until we heard from the
man in Paris, at least, we should be keeping our
word about it.”
</p>
<p>
Elinor and Mary were all for telling, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
other girls were still under the spell of the very
beautiful and distressed woman, and since it was
mostly their affair they concluded not to tell.
</p>
<p>
You must not blame Billie for this want of
frankness. Girls who have never had mothers
to talk to in the intimate way that only a mother
and daughter know, are apt to be reserved and
self-reliant. Billie would certainly have told her
father, but, then, he was in Russia.
</p>
<p>
Mary and Elinor, whose room adjoined the
other, had put on their kimonos and were lolling
on the beds, while Nancy with solicitous care was
removing her pretty muslin frock from the valise
and smoothing out the pink taffeta ribbons tenderly.
</p>
<p>
Billie knelt on the floor and opened her suit
case.
</p>
<p>
“Before I undress,” she said decisively, “I’m
going to take this box straight down stairs and
give it to the clerk to put in the safe. Then we
can spend the evening with easy minds.”
</p>
<p>
She flung back the top and sat down on the
floor with a gasp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“In the name of all the powers, this is not my
suit case.”
</p>
<p>
The girls gathered around her in great excitement.
</p>
<p>
“It’s exactly like mine,” she went on, “but
there are no initials on it and mine has ‘W.H.C.’
on the end.”
</p>
<p>
“Girls,” cried Nancy, flinging her bathrobe
around her with a tragic gesture, “the very last
person in the world we could wish to have Billie’s
suit case is the very one who has it. She’ll look
at everything in it; examine the underclothes to
see if they are hand-made and the stockings to see
if they are silk, and—she’ll open the box of jewels
and read the card of the avocat from Paris and——”
</p>
<p>
“Who? Who?” interrupted the other three.
</p>
<p>
“Who but Belle Rogers,” cried Nancy, flourishing
a towel in one hand and a hair brush in the
other.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that’s her costume,” admitted Mary,
laughing. “Blue chiffon with a wreath of pink
roses for her hair.”
</p>
<p>
She pulled up a corner of the pale blue gauzy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
material and pointed to a little pink wreath which
lay in the folds of the dress.
</p>
<p>
“There are her blue satin slippers, No. Two’s,
absolutely not a size larger,” said Elinor, pointing
to the toe of a little slipper which showed at
one end of the suit case.
</p>
<p>
“This is what I get for losing the keys to
everything,” groaned Billie. “Telephone for a
boy, quick, some one, while I fasten this thing
up. Perhaps she hasn’t opened mine yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Opened it!” echoed the others. “You don’t
know her.”
</p>
<p>
Presently a bell boy tapped at the door.
</p>
<p>
Billie gave him the suit case with full instructions.
</p>
<p>
“And hurry,” she added. “If you are back
here in five minutes, you shall have an extra tip.”
</p>
<p>
Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed. The other
girls were almost dressed, and Billie was beginning
to tap the floor nervously with an impatient
foot, when at last there was a tap at the door.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you come sooner?” demanded
Nancy and Billie in one voice.
</p>
<p>
“The young lady wouldn’t let me, Miss.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
“But what was she doing all that time?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, Miss. She simply told me to
wait outside. She was very angry, Miss, about
her bag.”
</p>
<p>
“Angry, indeed,” answered Billie, seizing her
own suit case. “At least no time was lost in
sending it to her.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls opened the suit case with great
anxiety. The things in it were assuredly in
rather a rumpled condition. They had the appearance
of having been unfolded and hastily
rolled up again in new folds.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could be told about the box of jewels.
They were all there apparently in a glittering
bunch with the card laid on top.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me, I’m sorry that combination lock
broke,” exclaimed Billie. “I don’t mind Belle
Rogers looking through my clothes if it gives
her any satisfaction, but I would just as soon she
hadn’t looked into this box of jewels. And we
can’t explain to her, because we mustn’t seem to
know that she was capable of doing anything so
low and common as to go through my suit case.”
</p>
<p>
She dressed herself hastily in a pretty white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
frock. Her smooth rolls of hair and trim braid
did not need re-arranging, and she hurried downstairs
to the desk with the troublesome box, which
she gave into the charge of the clerk.
</p>
<p>
“These are some really valuable things,” she
said. “Will you put them in your safe?”
</p>
<p>
The clerk wrapped the box up neatly in heavy
brown paper, sealed it with red sealing wax, labelled
it with her name and address and deposited
it in the safe.
</p>
<p>
“That’s off my mind,” she said, giving a sigh
of relief, just as the elevator door opened and
Miss Campbell appeared with the other girls.
</p>
<p>
“Cousin Helen, you’re a dream,” cried Billie,
taking her cousin’s arm. “You are like a young
girl whose hair had gone and turned white in a
single night.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, my dear, but you may be sure that
if anything happened which could make my hair
turn white in a night, it wouldn’t leave me any
girlish looks. But why didn’t you come to my
room and let me have a look at you? Are you
all exactly right and in place? That’s a sweet little
frock. I suppose you got it in Paris last summer. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
and your father are a pair of children
shopping together, I imagine. All my girls
look sweet,” she added, not wishing to wound any
feelings by admiring one more than another.
“See this lovely dress my little Mary is wearing.
Could anything be more exquisitely made than
that? Your mother is a wonderful woman, child.
There’s nobody like her in West Haven.”
</p>
<p>
At dinner there was another surprise for the
girls. This time it was an agreeable one: four
extra places at the table, and presently they were
joined by four West Haven boys, looking rather
embarrassed but quite happy as they shook hands
with the fairy godmother of the party, Billie’s
Cousin Helen.
</p>
<p>
Two of the boys we have met before, Ben Austen
and Charlie Clay. The other two were their
intimate friends and boon companions, Americus
Brown, Nancy’s brother, known as “Merry
Brown,” and Percival Algernon St. Clair, whose
mother’s fancy had run riot in naming her only
child. He was called “Percy” by his friends for
short.
</p>
<p>
“Why, look who’s here,” exclaimed Nancy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
“Percival Algernon St. Clair, why didn’t you tell
us yesterday when you gave us soda water at the
drug store that you were coming on this trip,
too?”
</p>
<p>
“Because it was secret,” answered Percy, who
was very blond and blushed easily. “Miss Campbell
wanted to surprise you.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought it would be nice for my girls to have
some partners for the dance to-night,” said Miss
Campbell. “I wanted to see some real dancing.”
</p>
<p>
“If you want to see the real thing, then, Miss
Campbell,” said Merry Brown, “if you want to
see the poetry of motion, you must see Ben
dance.”
</p>
<p>
“Shut up, bow-legs,” called Ben across the table.
“I’ve been learning for months. I took lessons
last summer.”
</p>
<p>
“Where?” demanded his friends, because at
the school dances, Ben’s expression of misery
was well known when he towed an unfortunate
friend around the room.
</p>
<p>
“I know,” said Percy, “it’s all explained now.
That’s what you were doing at the Dutch picnics
every week.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, they were pretty good teachers,” replied
the imperturbable Ben. “They taught me that
guiding a girl in a dance was very much like
sailing a boat with a windmill for a sail. You
have to guide and twirl at the same time, and the
more speed you make in twirling the better your
dancing is.”
</p>
<p>
Everybody laughed uproariously at this description.
</p>
<p>
“Ben Austen, I didn’t expect to be treated like
a windmill sail boat when I promised to give you
my first dance,” announced Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“It would be better than to be treated like a
stationary windmill and go turning around in
one place like the Germans dance,” observed
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“You may all have your choice,” said Ben.
“Stationary or progressive, it’s all one to me, only
remember that you have each promised to do a
Dutch twirl with me.”
</p>
<p>
The ballroom was already quite filled with dancers
and it seemed very bewildering and delightful
to the young girls, if it was only a summer
hotel with a piano and two violins and a flute for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
an orchestra. Ben’s Dutch whirl was so skillfully
performed, because like everything else he
attempted he had mastered it perfectly, that the
girls found it rather exciting fun.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a regular romp,” cried Billie, who, with
glowing cheeks, dropped breathlessly into a chair
beside her Cousin Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Look,” whispered Mary Price, who had been
dancing a quiet glide with Charlie Clay and had
had a chance to notice some of the other dancers.
</p>
<p>
For some reason both their young faces turned
suddenly very grave. Was it a strange, unexplained
premonition that told them the most dangerous
enemy either was ever to have was dancing
past that moment, in floating pale blue chiffon
draperies?
</p>
<p>
After the dance there was a merry supper
party with sandwiches and lemonade in the grill
room, and then the Motor Maids were glad
enough to get to their beds.
</p>
<p>
“What a relief it is, Nancy, dear, to have that
box of jewels in the safe,” said Billie sleepily, as
her eyelids drooped and she settled herself under
the covers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
But Nancy did not reply. She was sleeping
deeply. Billie, too, was soon oblivious of everything
in the world.
</p>
<p>
As the night wore on, Nancy dreamed that
she was dancing the Dutch twirl in a wonderful
blue gauze dress, but that the diamond necklace
she wore so weighed her down that she could not
breathe.
</p>
<p>
Billie also dreamed of the diamonds. They
were not around her neck, but in their box, which
had grown to the size of a trunk and pressed on
her chest so heavily that she was suffocating.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a great bell clanged out in the night.
</p>
<p>
Billie opened her eyes with difficulty. The
room was filled with smoke and down the corridor
there came the cry of “Fire! Fire!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—THE FIRE.</h2>
<p>
A bell with a deep baying note rang out in the
darkness.
</p>
<p>
If you have ever heard a fire bell boom out in
the stillness, you will remember the terror which
clutched your heart at the first ominous peal. It
seemed to Billie, in going over it afterward, that
the boom of that big fire bell was like the last
trump on the day of judgment arousing the
spirits of the dead.
</p>
<p>
Then came the sound of voices. The corridors
were filled with hurrying footsteps. Somebody
ran down the hallway calling again:
</p>
<p>
“Fire! Fire!”
</p>
<p>
Billie jumped to the floor with a bound. Her
senses had returned at last.
</p>
<p>
“Nancy, Nancy!” she cried, shaking her friend
violently back to consciousness. “The hotel is on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
fire. Get into your dressing gown as quickly as
you can while I wake up the others.”
</p>
<p>
As she switched on the light she saw that the
room was filled with smoke, and she knew the
fire must be in their wing of the hotel and that
there was no time to lose.
</p>
<p>
There is no better fire trap in the world than
a wooden hotel at the seaside. The salt from
the flying spray in winter storms has seasoned the
wood into splendid burning material, and the
breeze from the ocean fans the flames like a great
natural bellows.
</p>
<p>
As Billie waked the other girls Miss Campbell
came into the room, with a white, scared face.
But she was not excited.
</p>
<p>
“Get into your dressing gowns, girls,” she said
quietly. “Don’t lose a moment’s time. The boys
are waiting for us outside.”
</p>
<p>
Just then Ben Austen rattled on the door.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry,” he called. “The elevators won’t run
much longer and the stairs are burning.”
</p>
<p>
Hardly two minutes had passed since the first
clang of the bell when Miss Campbell and the
girls joined the boys in the corridor. There had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
not been time even to snatch up a hair-pin from
the bureau to catch tumbled locks together. But
nobody looked at any one else. The place was
crowded with hotel guests in exactly the same
condition and all the passages opening into the
main corridor of the hotel were emptying themselves
of streams of people in every state of disarray.
If it had been less serious, the girls
might have laughed at the numbers of terrified
and hysterical fat women, wrapping insufficient
dressing gowns and blankets about their large
forms as they pushed their way without ceremony
toward the elevators.
</p>
<p>
But a big tongue of flame suddenly leapt up
the stairwell at the end of the hall. There was
a crackling sound and clouds of black smoke
poured into the corridor.
</p>
<p>
“We must get out of this,” exclaimed Ben.
“The fire has reached this floor and unless we
knock a few people down, we’ll never get to either
of those elevators.”
</p>
<p>
“But where are the fire escapes?” demanded
Miss Campbell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
“At the end of the hall,” answered Charlie,
“and we could never get past that burning pit.”
</p>
<p>
The two elevators had been up and down several
times, packed with people. The smoke was
growing thicker each moment, and the next thing
Billie remembered was that Elinor had fainted
dead away, and that some one had screamed:
</p>
<p>
“The elevators have stopped running!”
</p>
<p>
In the stifling atmosphere she saw Ben and
Charlie lift Elinor and call to the others to follow
them into a bedroom. As she staggered
after them, a grotesque figure, screaming hysterically,
fought through the crowd, almost
knocking Billie down. Even in that moment of
danger she recognized Belle Rogers, every lock
of whose golden hair was done up on red rubber
curlers, the ends of which stuck straight up
like scores of little devils’ horns.
</p>
<p>
“Take me down! Take me down!” Billie heard
her scream. “I will not die in this horrible way!
Somebody save me!”
</p>
<p>
Billie touched her on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t scream,” she said. “It only makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
things worse. The people who are left are going
to get down by the windows. Come with us.”
</p>
<p>
Belle, who had been separated from her
friends, followed quietly enough.
</p>
<p>
In another moment the corridor was empty,
and the flames which had been fast eating their
way along the hall had reached the elevator
shafts. It had all happened in much less time
than it takes to tell, but in the brief instant when
Billie had paused to rescue Belle, she lost the
others. Once in a bedroom, where the air was
not so stifling, it was impossible to leave and rush
again into the atmosphere outside.
</p>
<p>
The two girls dashed into the nearest room and
closed the door, too stifled to notice that the others,
led by level-headed Ben and followed by the
crowd of people left standing by the elevator
shafts, had rushed into a front room at the end
of the hall. In the closets of this room and the
one adjoining, they found two fire ropes which this
old-fashioned hotel provided for its guests whose
rooms were not located near the fire escapes.
Those who were not able to slide down the ropes
were lowered in a chair, and the others, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
foot twisted around the rope and grasping a wet
towel to keep the palm of the hand from blistering,
slid down. In the darkness it was impossible
to recognize faces, and it was not until they
were all safe on the ground that they missed Billie
Campbell.
</p>
<p>
Then poor Miss Campbell, who had been admirably
calm during the whole fearful experience,
fainted away, and Elinor, now entirely restored
by the fresh air, was left to take care of
her.
</p>
<p>
Nancy and Mary followed the four boys to the
rescue. Tears were rolling down Nancy’s cheeks
and Mary was as pale as death. Each girl had
her own peculiar way of showing how much she
had come to love their new friend, Billie.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Billie, herself, was looking
ruefully down into the darkness from the window
of a room on the third floor and Belle was
indulging in a fit of real hysterics.
</p>
<p>
“How dare you bring me here?” she screamed
hoarsely, stamping her foot. “I might have been
saved if you had let me alone, and here we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
trapped! I always hated you and now I detest
you with my whole soul.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought the others were in here,” said Billie
apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“Thought! Thought!” screamed the wretched
girl. “You wanted me to die. You wanted me
to lose my beauty.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t any to lose just now,” answered
Billie. “You look more like the Medusa of the
snaky locks——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” wept Belle, too angry to articulate.
</p>
<p>
“You may console yourself this much,” went on
Billie. “If you die, I shall die with you, but I am
going to do my best to save you and myself, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Help! Help!” screamed Belle from the window,
not taking any notice. But her voice was
lost in the wild clamor which came up from below.
</p>
<p>
Then she flung herself flat on the floor in an
agony of sobs.
</p>
<p>
“It’s better to pray than to cry, Belle. Crying
won’t help and we are in a pretty warm place.
If you were only a sport, it might do a lot of
good.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
Belle crawled to the window and leaned out.
The air in the room was becoming unbearable.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Billie’s thoughts were working
rapidly. There were the sheets, but there
wasn’t time to tear them into strips and knot the
strips together. Besides, she didn’t believe they
would reach halfway to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid we’ll have to climb it,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Climb what?”
</p>
<p>
“Climb up the side of the shutter to the roof.
This is the top floor. The flames haven’t reached
the roof yet.”
</p>
<p>
“But what good will the roof do us?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet, but it’s better than this.
Come on.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you I can’t climb. I never did such a
thing in my life.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll just have to begin then,” said Billie
sternly. “Shall I go first, or would you rather
do it?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go—no, you go.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll help you,” said Billie, hoisting herself to
the window ledge. “Now, don’t look down. Just
imagine you are only a few feet from the ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
and that it’s a very easy stunt. If you decide beforehand
that you can’t do it, why, of course,
you can’t. But it will be much easier than staying
here to be burned alive in the next few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
Delivering herself of this boyish but unimpeachable
logic, Billie kicked off her slippers and
swung herself onto the shutter. Just for one
brief instant a sickening nausea came over her as
she looked down into the darkness.
</p>
<p>
Then her fingers grasped the cornice of the
roof and, pulling herself up with her two arms,
as she had learned to do on the parallel bars in
the gymnasium—only in this instance the shutter
made a very uncertain elbow rest—she scrambled
onto the roof.
</p>
<p>
“All right, Belle,” she called. “It’s much
easier than I thought. Take off your slippers and
come ahead, and don’t forget to look up and not
down.”
</p>
<p>
Belle obeyed in sullen silence. She was as determined
as Billie not to be burned alive, but her
luxurious and self-indulgent nature revolted
against this uncomfortable and dangerous method
of getting out of the difficulty. However, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
was nothing else to do, so she swung out on the
shutter as Billie had done, only this time Billie,
with all the strength in her body was holding the
shutter rigid.
</p>
<p>
As Belle clung on with her hands and her little
pink toes, which she had stuck into the interstices
of the shutter, she suddenly looked down.
Her grasp weakened and she gave a shriek so
piercing that Billie almost slipped headlong over
the side of the roof, but she grasped Belle’s slackening
wrist.
</p>
<p>
“Take a breath,” she said, in a trembling voice.
“You can do it, if you only make up your mind
to.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll never, never forgive you,” cried Belle,
“and if I live through to-night, I’ll pay you back.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” answered Billie calmly, seeing all
at once that anger appeared to give Belle new
strength, “only I advise you to get onto this roof
first.”
</p>
<p>
Another moment and Belle had clambered over
the cornice and was stretched out breathless on
the roof.
</p>
<p>
“I would much rather have had a baby to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
after,” thought Billie, as she looked contemptuously
down at the other girl.
</p>
<p>
“We had better not lose any more time now,
Belle,” she said aloud. “If you have got your
breath and your nerve back, come ahead.”
</p>
<p>
Belle pulled herself wearily up and followed.
</p>
<p>
“My feet are all splinters,” she complained,
“and my hands are torn and bleeding.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“’Tis the voice of the lobster: I heard him declare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair,’”<br />
</p>
<p>
repeated Billie, half laughing and half sobbing
that this foolish verse should have flashed
through her brain at this strange time.
</p>
<p>
The two girls hurried along the roof toward
the front. It was plain that in the scramble to
save the lives of the hotel guests there had been
no time to save the building, and when the young
girls turned the corner of the roof and looked for
a moment across the broad expanse of ocean not
a hundred yards away it seemed to them that they
were alone in the whole world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“What are we going to do now?” demanded
Belle.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet,” answered Billie patiently.
</p>
<p>
The roof was hot under her feet and they could
hear the crackling of flames as they hastened
along the edge to the other side.
</p>
<p>
The rest of that fearful adventure seemed like
a dream to Billie afterwards.
</p>
<p>
As they turned the corner of the house a voice
called hoarsely:
</p>
<p>
“Who can tie a rope?”
</p>
<p>
Billie remembered to have replied vaguely and
politely that she could tie a rope. A man emerged
from behind the chimney with a long rope, but
she hardly noticed at the time that he had only
one arm.
</p>
<p>
“It may not be long enough,” he said, “but tie
it and we’ll take the risk. It’s our only chance.”
</p>
<p>
Billie knotted the rope around the chimney.
The man examined the knot carefully, pulled it
with his one hand, and then threw it over the side
of the house.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go first,” said Belle quietly, and Billie
looked at her with amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” said the man. “You are brave.
Can you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Belle, “I can do anything.
Help me over the side.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to hurt,” he observed, as he twisted
the rope around her foot and showed her how to
slide down. “It’s going to take all the skin off
your hands and feet and maybe cut to the bone.”
</p>
<p>
Belle made no reply to this cheerful prediction.
She had already started down the rope.
</p>
<p>
As Billie watched her disappear in the dark,
the man said abruptly:
</p>
<p>
“Did a number of girls and a white-haired
woman in a red automobile come here this evening?”
</p>
<p>
Billie hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“I believe so,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know so?” asked the man insistently.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you see one of them leave a rosewood box
at the clerk’s desk?”
</p>
<p>
Billie made a great effort to remember. Then,
suddenly, the case of jewels loomed up in her
mind. She had forgotten all about them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
“Billie, Billie,” called a voice from below.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, looking over the roof.
</p>
<p>
“She’s here,” shouted Ben, from the top of the
ladder, which reached only to the second story.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” called the one-armed man on the
roof. “We have a rope here. We’ll swing down
to the ladder.”
</p>
<p>
The next thing Billie remembered she was surrounded
by a crowd of her friends at the foot of
the ladder. The girls were weeping and her
Cousin Helen was giving vent to hysterical expressions
of relief and thankfulness. The wet
sand felt cool and soft to the parched soles of
her bare feet, and she tried to smile; but she
really had quite forgotten what it was all about.
Some one close by her groaned and sobbed alternately,
and a sickening feeling came over her
when she saw a girl stretched on a blanket almost
at her feet. The girl’s hands were torn and
bleeding and her pale blue silk kimono was covered
with blood. Down one cheek was a long,
bloody mark and to complete her grotesque and
terrible aspect, at least a dozen little red rubber
devils’ horns stood upright all over her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
The next thing Billie remembered was huddling
into her own beloved red motor car with
the others, while some one took them somewhere,
and all the time in her ears she heard a man’s
voice saying:
</p>
<p>
“Where is that box of jewels?”
</p>
<p>
And her own voice replied:
</p>
<p>
“Under the ruins of the Shell Island Hotel.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—NANCY’S HOME.</h2>
<p>
Nancy’s home was a favorite meeting place of
the four friends. There was something very inviting
about the old red brick house, with its low-ceiled,
cheerful rooms and deep-silled windows.
</p>
<p>
Nancy’s family had been seafaring people for
many generations, and the place was filled with
curios from foreign countries: carved chests,
swords with curved blades, ivory elephants, funny
little cross-legged grinning gods, beautiful Japanese
vases and Oriental rugs.
</p>
<p>
In cool weather there seemed to be a perpetual
piece of old driftwood crackling on the hearth,
and there was nothing the girls enjoyed more
than sitting in a row on the floor in front of that
cheerful blaze while they drank tea from curious
Japanese cups and nibbled some of Mrs. Brown’s
delicate cookies.
</p>
<p>
Nancy’s father was the very picture of a sea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
captain, sunburned, ruddy, eyes very blue and
little side whiskers like an English Squire’s. He
had a hundred stories to tell of the sea, and Billie
could have listened to him all day without tiring.
Nancy’s mother was a gay, cheerful little body
who kept her house polished like a ship’s cabin,
and Nancy’s brother, Merry, was the image of
his father. He felt the call of the sea, too, as
his father and grandfather had before him, but
he was not to be the captain of a merchant ship.
He intended to go to Annapolis.
</p>
<p>
Three weeks had passed since the great fire at
Shell Island, when, one Saturday afternoon, a
red motor car wound its way in and out of the
country vehicles on Main Street, stopped at the
express office, where the young mistress of the
car alighted for a moment, returning with a package,
and then, with a reckless flourish, turned
into lower Cliff Street and presently stopped in
front of Nancy’s house.
</p>
<p>
Billie entered without ceremony, so intimate
had she now become with the Brown household.
Concealing the package in her gray ulster, she
left it in the hall. Then, with the boyish freedom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
which seemed to characterize all her ways, pulling
off her gray hat and gloves, she marched into the
parlor.
</p>
<p>
Nancy was huddled up on the settle doing the
family darning, a Saturday task she loathed.
Elinor was playing softly on the square piano
between the front windows and Mary Price was
reading a book.
</p>
<p>
“I hope I don’t disturb any one,” said Billie,
laughing as she burst into the room. “Everybody
seems to be so busy here. I’m the only idle creature
living to-day. Even Cousin Helen is at
work.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope she is doing something more to her
taste than this,” said Nancy mournfully. “I’d
rather dig for clams any day. Merry would wear
out a sock made of steel chains.”
</p>
<p>
“Hark, a doleful voice from the tombs,” cried
Merry, who always made it an excuse to hunt
for something in the parlor when Billie appeared.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the truth,” complained Nancy. “If you
would just keep still two minutes at a time, I
wouldn’t have to give up my Saturdays slaving
for you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘When I hear the music play, I can’t keep
right still,’” sang Merry, executing a double
shuffle on the floor to a jig tune Elinor had struck
up.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have to dance to a different tune when
you go to Annapolis,” cried Nancy. “And who’ll
do your darning there?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t borrow trouble, Nancy,” answered her
brother. “Perform your daily task and cease to
murmur. You’ll be a professional grumbler like
Belle Rogers if you keep on.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know that she and her whole family
are denouncing me as a sort of would-be murderer?”
put in Billie. “All because I lost Ben and
the rest of you at the Shell Island fire and took
her into the wrong room.”
</p>
<p>
“I heard that she was an early Christian martyr
who had come near to being burned at the
stake,” said Merry.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” continued Billie, “she tells how I enticed
her into the room, and then climbed up onto
the roof and left her, so that she had to follow
and she even blames me because she would slide
down the rope first and cut her hands so that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
will never be able to play the piano. I am very
sorry for that, because she liked music, but it was
her own fault.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s really making a sort of split-up in the
town,” observed Elinor. “Mrs. Rogers and
mamma almost had words on the subject the other
day. As much as mamma will ever have words
with any one. Mrs. Rogers tried to tell her that
Belle was going one way and you made her go
another, and all mamma said was, ‘My dear Julia,
I have heard the correct version of the story,’
and swept away.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly as you will do, Elinor, when you begin
to wear long dresses,” said Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she can sweep without a train,” cried
Merry, giving a very good imitation of Elinor as
he made for the door with his baseball bat and
glove.
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t be silly, Americus Brown,” called
Elinor after him. “Remember that you are to
be a soldier of the nation some day, and you’ll
have to stop walking pigeon-toed, then, and keep
your bow-legs straight and stop grinning. It
will be very difficult, I fear.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
Merry shot a coffee bean at her with his thumb
and forefinger as he left the room.
</p>
<p>
“That boy will be the death of me,” exclaimed
Nancy. “He reminds me of our sailor weather-cock
in the garden that waves his arms and legs
and turns every time there is the slightest
breeze.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s a nice boy,” said Billie, who always took
Merry’s side in the arguments. “But I am here
this morning, as the preacher says, to ask your
advice in a grave matter. Several grave matters,
in fact.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you heard from Mr. Lafitte?” demanded
the three girls in unison.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Billie, “and it’s been nearly three
weeks since we sent my name and address. Perhaps
there hasn’t been time, but I should think
they might have cabled, or something.”
</p>
<p>
“It only postpones the evil day of telling them
the jewels were lost in the fire,” observed Mary.
</p>
<p>
Billie disappeared in the hall for a moment and
returned with the package she had hidden in her
ulster.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“The jewels came back by express this morning,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
“For heaven’s sake!” cried the others.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether to be glad or sorry,”
said Billie. “I am sure Pandora’s box didn’t have
any more troubles locked inside of it than this one
has. What shall I do with it now?”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you tell Miss Campbell all about
it?” suggested Elinor, for the second time.
</p>
<p>
“But, Elinor, it wouldn’t be right,” answered
Billie. “Didn’t we give the woman our word of
honor, Nancy, that we would keep the box for
her until she sent for it, and tell no one? Even
you and Mary would not have known about it
if you hadn’t attacked Nancy like two wild Comanche
Indians and knocked the box open.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think the woman was crazy, honestly
now?” Elinor asked for the hundredth time.
This was an old argument between the girls.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t,” answered Billie emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“She was much too beautiful and fascinating to
be crazy,” put in Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“They are the craziest of all sometimes,” said
Elinor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“But to return to the jewels,” interrupted
Mary, the peacemaker. “Did the hotel people
send them back?”
</p>
<p>
“No, that’s the queerest thing of all, and that’s
what I’m here for to tell you now. The hotel
people wrote me a letter which came this morning,
saying that it was believed that the fire had
been started by thieves who robbed the safe and
that they, therefore, were not responsible for
things lost.
</p>
<p>
“In the same mail came another very nice letter
from a strange man named Johnston. He
said the night of the fire he saw a man who was
carrying this package faint dead away on the
bridge. He believes now the man was one of
the thieves. Anyway, he took him into his automobile
and the thief must have come to and not
known where he was, because he escaped somehow,
probably to go back and look for the package,
which Mr. Johnston has expressed to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all the strange stories!”
</p>
<p>
“But the question is now, what to do with the
thing?” continued Billie.
</p>
<p>
If Billie had been a few years older, she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
probably have gone straight to Miss Campbell,
or to Miss Campbell’s lawyer, Mr. Richard Butler,
Elinor’s uncle, for advice. The jewels would
then have been stored in the bank for safe-keeping
and proper means taken to find the owner.
But it seemed to her that having given her word
she must keep it, and hide the jewels herself in
some safe place until she heard from Mr. Lafitte.
After all, he might be on a journey somewhere,
and they could only wait patiently.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go and consult our guide, counsellor,
and friend,” suggested Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Who?” asked the other girls, in some doubt.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the motor car, of course. Isn’t he the
cheerfullest, finest friend in the world; always
ready to give pleasure; always smiling and ruddy,
and ready to come and go, stay still or move on—bless
him?”
</p>
<p>
“He is a dear,” said Billie, pleased with this
extravagant praise of her beloved car.
</p>
<p>
The girls had come to consider “The Comet”
almost as a living thing, like a pet horse or a
favorite dog. They loved it as ardently as children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
love a pony which has borne them all on his
back at one time around the garden.
</p>
<p>
It was decided then to take a spin in the car
and the four friends were soon in their accustomed
places on the red leather seats.
</p>
<p>
The scarlet car, full of young girls, was no
longer an unusual sight in the town of West
Haven, and people had ceased now to turn and
stare at the “Motor Maids,” as Captain Brown
had christened them one morning when they had
taken him for a drive in the automobile.
</p>
<p>
Through the town they sped and out to the
open road. The crisp autumn air nipped their
cheeks and brought the color to their faces. As
they passed Boulder Lane they looked curiously
at the fisherman’s house in the distance.
</p>
<p>
“I am certain those men who took your car
were smugglers,” announced Nancy. “Father
says there are lots of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” said Billie, “and I am certain of
another thing: that it was the same one-armed
man who was on the roof of the hotel the night
of the fire.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
“But there are lots of one-armed men in the
world, child,” replied Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, but there was something familiar
about him. And, besides, why did he ask me
those questions about the girls at the hotel in the
red automobile?”
</p>
<p>
“And, ‘curiser and curiser,’ what did he want
with the box of jewels? And how did he know
we had them?” said Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“I really couldn’t say,” answered Nancy. “Ask
me something easier.”
</p>
<p>
Seeing nothing ahead of them in the road,
Billie had let the car go full speed. It was what
they all loved, even Mary Price, who had gradually
got over a certain timidity she used to feel
when the car shot through the air like a sky-rocket,
and it was Mary Price now, grown unusually
bold from familiarity with speeding, who
suddenly jumped up and cried in her high, sweet
voice:
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got it! I’ve got it!”
</p>
<p>
“Got what?” demanded the others.
</p>
<p>
“Why, a place to put the jewels in, of course.
Mother’s safe.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“But would she like us to use her safe?” asked
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“She won’t mind. I’ll tell her it’s something of
yours. She never uses it. We haven’t anything
to keep in it now,” Mary added simply. “Father
used it in his life time and Mother has just kept
it since because we are always expecting to make
lots of money, you know, and then we might need
it. I know the combination, and we can
go straight home and put them in. No one would
ever think of looking for jewels in our little
house, and they ought to be as safe there as any
place in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“Mary, dear, you are a trump,” exclaimed
Billie. “It’s a perfect idea.”
</p>
<p>
In another moment, they had faced about and
were on their way back to town.
</p>
<p>
“Dear old car,” ejaculated Elinor, patting the
red leather tenderly. “Mary’s right, we couldn’t
get on without you. We consult you exactly as
the ancients consulted oracles. I think all your
cushions must be stuffed with good advice, instead
of horse hair, and your big all-seeing eye
is always on the lookout for danger——”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“And his heart is true to his jolly crew,” sang
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“He is better than a horse,” put in Mary, “because
he never gets tired.”
</p>
<p>
“And when he’s empty we fill him with gasoline,
and he’ll go ahead as fresh as ever,” went
on Billie.
</p>
<p>
“And he always avoids broken glass and tacks
in the road,” Elinor was saying, when “bang!”
went one of the rear tires with a report as loud
as a pistol shot.
</p>
<p>
The “jolly crew” could not restrain their ever-ready
laughter at this disconcerting behavior on
the part of “The Comet” just at the very moment
when their boasts were loudest.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well,” said Billie apologetically, “it’s time
we had a puncture. We’ve never had one yet.
We’ll take him to the garage and have him mended
properly.”
</p>
<p>
“Chocolates, marshmallows, peanut brittle, and
other candies, fresh and dee-lishus!” called a
voice from behind the motor as they pulled into
the garage.
</p>
<p>
It was Percival Algernon St. Clair, wearing a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
most engaging smile on his rosy, good-natured
face, as he tipped his boyish cap at Nancy in particular
in the most approved grown-up fashion.
</p>
<p>
“Have you any ice cream sodas, Percy-Algy?”
demanded Nancy impudently.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think the fountain’s dry yet, Nancy,
and we’ll have a party, if you say so. The gang
is close by. Shall I give the signal?”
</p>
<p>
“I have no objections,” said Nancy, “if the
girls haven’t.”
</p>
<p>
“Why should we?” answered Billie. “Isn’t
pineapple soda water my favorite beverage?”
</p>
<p>
Percy put two fingers to his lips and gave three
whistles, and, as if by magic, Ben Austen, Charlie
Clay, and Merry Brown emerged from the
shadow of a neighboring doorway.
</p>
<p>
In spite of his theatrical name, his girlish complexion,
and blond hair, Percy was a great favorite
with his friends. He had received a spoiling
from his doting and indulgent mother that would
have turned many another boy into a selfish, vain
egoist. But Percy had been saved from this
wretched fate partly by his own frank and engaging
disposition and partly by association with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
his three chums, Charlie, Ben, and Merry, wholesome,
manly boys, who had never been mollycoddled
in their lives.
</p>
<p>
“Will some one carry this parcel then?” asked
Billie, pulling the box of jewels from under the
seat, and tearing the wrapping paper off of a
corner as she did so.
</p>
<p>
“I will,” said Merry promptly, taking charge
of the box. “Why, it’s rather heavy,” he observed,
weighing it in his hand. “It must be
full of gold nuggets.”
</p>
<p>
Billie was silent. She was beginning to be a
little superstitious about that box, and she could
have wished that the punctured tire and the soda
water party, pleasant as was this last diversion,
had not interrupted their plan to store the box
in Mrs. Price’s safe.
</p>
<p>
But Billie enjoyed being with girls and boys of
her own age so much that she soon forgot her
doubts and joined in the gay conversation of the
little company.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday afternoons a crowd of High
School boys and girls was always congregated
around the soda water fountain in the West
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
Haven Pharmacy, as it was called, and the place
was filled with gay talk and laughter, when the
Motor Maids and their friends pushed their way
up to the marble counter, while Percy, who had
more pocket money in a week than some of the
others had in a year, paid for the checks.
</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, Billie and Americus
Brown had found places next to Belle Rogers,
who, very daintily and delicately, though with
some thoroughness, was consuming a maple-nut
sundae.
</p>
<p>
Merry pushed the box onto the counter while
he plunged into a glass of chocolate soda water
without even noticing that Belle had turned a
scornful glance, first at him and then at the much
soiled and travel-stained wrapper on the package.
Then, suddenly, something very particular
claimed her attention. Mary Price, who was
standing around the curve of the counter, saw
the whole thing and reported it later to the girls.
Where Billie had torn the paper, the polished
rosewood surface of the box, with its silver
mounting, was plainly visible. Belle gave one
long, astonished stare of recognition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“After we leave this package at Mary’s, I invite
all of you to take a ride in the motor,” Billie
was saying to Merry Brown. “Do you think
eight can sit where five are in the habit of sitting?”
</p>
<p>
“One seat will be big enough for the midgets,”—a
nickname given to Mary and Charlie,—Merry
answered. “One of us can sit on the floor
and the other four can squeeze onto the back seat.
The chauffeur is the only person who must have
plenty of room.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you move up and give us a little room?”
interrupted Nancy, pushing her way between her
brother and his neighbor, while Percy stood patiently
by with two glasses of soda water.
</p>
<p>
Without meaning it, she had jostled Belle
Rogers. The two girls turned and faced each
other.
</p>
<p>
“How do you do, Belle? Are you quite well
again?” asked Nancy politely, but with a look in
her eyes which meant mischief.
</p>
<p>
Belle had not been back to school since the
fire.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Brown,” said Belle, bowing stiffly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“How well your hair stays in curl this foggy
weather, Belle,” continued Nancy, in a high,
pleasant voice, which could be heard by all the
boys and girls at the counter. “You must put it
up almost every night now, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Nancy!” expostulated Billie, as Belle sailed
from the drug store, followed by several of her
loyal friends.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—AT THE SIGN OF THE BLUE TEA POT.</h2>
<p>
Billie was thankful when they had got the box
of jewels safely back into the motor car and
were on their way at last to Mary’s home.
</p>
<p>
Mary and her mother lived in a pretty old
house facing the public square, and it was fortunate
that Mrs. Price’s old home was so located.
In order to support herself and her little daughter,
the young widow had transformed the lower
floor into a tea room and shop. A little blue
board hung from the portico, which bore the inscription
in old English script, “At Ye Signe of
Ye Blue Tea Pot.” A large bulletin on the front
door announced that tea and sandwiches of all
varieties could be had within; also that luncheons
were prepared for pleasure parties and journeys
and that numerous dainty and pretty articles,
made by hand, were there for sale.
</p>
<p>
The inscription might have stated further that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
the plucky mistress of the little shop was as dainty
and pretty as any of the articles for sale on the
counter.
</p>
<p>
As the soda water fountain was the Saturday
afternoon meeting place of the boys and girls of
West Haven, so the Sign of the Blue Tea Pot attracted
the older crowd. It had seemed a bold
undertaking for the widow to mortgage her home
and put all the money in the chintz hangings and
wicker furniture of those two charming tea
rooms. Her old friends, Mr. Butler and Captain
Brown, had strongly advised against it, but her
venture had been a success from the first, although
a mortgage still hung over the place like
a black cloud and small debts would accumulate
every time she got a little ahead.
</p>
<p>
When the red motor with its load of young
people drew up at the door of Mary’s home, the
buzz of conversation from inside reached them
out in the street.
</p>
<p>
Mary’s mother appeared for a moment in the
doorway, and smiled at them.
</p>
<p>
“She’s as beautiful as an angel,” thought Billie,
who never told how often she had yearned for a
real mother of her very own as other girls had.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
Could any one else have looked so charming in
a perfectly plain homemade gray chambray
dress, with a white muslin fichu, and little white
apron to set it off?
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you come in and have some tea and
cake, children?” Mrs. Price called to the young
people, while she put an arm around Mary and
shook hands with Billie, who had followed her
friend to the front door with the troublesome
box.
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you, Mrs. Price,” replied Billie, as
spokesman of the party. “I only came to ask a
favor,” she added, in a lower voice. “Would you
let me keep this box in your safe for a while? I
have no place, I mean——” Billie hesitated and
blushed. Of all things, she detested subterfuge,
and yet here she was making all sorts of lame excuses
instead of saying frankly that she was
keeping the box for a friend.
</p>
<p>
“You mean the old safe upstairs?” asked Mrs.
Price, somewhat astonished.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother,” put in Mary. “I told Billie I
knew you wouldn’t mind locking this box up for
her for a while.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
“Certainly, dear, you are welcome to hide anything
in it you like. Mary knows the combination
better than I do. I always have to look it
up in one of Captain Price’s old note books. I
am sorry you won’t have some tea and cake, but
I suppose you are all off for a spin this afternoon.
It has done Mary more good than I can tell you,
your motor car. The child is always studying
so hard to hurry up and be a teacher and take
care of her old mother, so she says.”
</p>
<p>
“Only a few years more, Mother, and you
shall never have to work again,” said Mary.
“Some day I shall be the Principal of West
Haven High School, when Miss Gray gets too old
to work——”
</p>
<p>
“What’s this?” exclaimed Miss Gray herself,
at the door. She had been drinking tea inside
with some friends. “Who’s going to lay me on
the shelf before my time?”
</p>
<p>
“Mary intends to step into your shoes, Miss
Gray,” laughed Mrs. Price. “Look out for her.
She is a dangerous rival. She means to pay off
all our mortgages and things, and provide for
her mother’s old age.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
Miss Gray pinched Mary’s cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” insisted Mary stoutly, “all I want is
money, money, money.”
</p>
<p>
The Principal patted the young girl’s cheek
kindly.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be too mad about it, child. It won’t buy
everything, you know.”
</p>
<p>
It was only an idle speech of Mary’s but you
all know how much meaning can sometimes be
given to words spoken thoughtlessly and the day
was to come when Mary was to regret very
deeply having used those words.
</p>
<p>
All this time Billie had been standing quietly
waiting for the moment when they could leave
the older people and consign the box to the iron
safe upstairs.
</p>
<p>
But before they could get away the tea room
began to empty itself. Billie’s Cousin Helen appeared
in the doorway, with Mrs. Butler, looking
like Elinor grown middle-aged, the beautiful
aquiline nose slightly more pronounced, the blue
eyes a little faded, but the same erect carriage
which made her look an inch or more taller than
the other women.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
Mme. Alta, the music teacher, was there with
Miss Gray. She was a fierce looking, dark-haired
woman, her two upper teeth protruding over her
lower lip like the tusks of a walrus, giving her a
cruel animal expression. Mrs. Rogers, Belle’s
mother, a small faded, intensely nervous little
woman, joined the group, followed by Percival
Algernon St. Clair’s doting parent, “the Widow
St. Clair,” as she was known, a charming, plump,
pretty woman, as good-natured as she was comfortably
self-indulgent.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Wilhelmina, my darling, what is that
large package you are carrying?” demanded Miss
Campbell anxiously. “Has your papa sent you
a present?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, just—just a package of things I was
going to leave here. We are going motoring for
a while. You don’t mind, do you Cousin Helen?”
</p>
<p>
“No, my child, as long as you don’t go too fast.
But do put down that box. You will injure yourself
carrying it so long. Why don’t you put it in
the motor? Why do you leave it here?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it isn’t mine,” said Billie.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Price looked up at this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
“But I thought——” she commenced, when
Mary pressed her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I mean I am keeping it for some one,” went
on Billie lamely.
</p>
<p>
“My dear Miss Campbell,” put in Miss Gray—and
Billie thanked her for the intervention—“it
is a Blue Bird secret, you may depend upon it.
You do not know school girls as well as I do.”
</p>
<p>
“It ees a ver-ry eenter-resting looking package,”
here remarked Mme. Alta. “It appears to
be a ver-ry handsome box, as I can plainly see by
one corner-r which protrudes. You perhaps use
if for your club’s segrets, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Billie turned the box guiltily around. She had
not noticed that the torn end was in view.
</p>
<p>
Mme. Alta looked at her unnecessarily hard,
Billie thought. She had never liked the strange
woman and had preferred not to take piano lessons
of her, after one glance at those hard, cruel
eyes and the fierce walrus teeth.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure it contains much more beautiful and
interesting things than stupid secrets,” exclaimed
good-natured, pretty Mrs. St. Clair, who disliked
to see anybody around her uncomfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
and Billie looked very uncomfortable. “Now,
dear,” she continued, giving Billie a little squeeze,
“do go and hide your box, if you like. It’s not
fair to quiz young girls about their secrets, any
more than it is to quiz older people,” and she
pushed Billie gently into the hall. Mary quickly
followed and the two girls ran upstairs, glad to
get away from the group of inquisitive ladies,
and infinitely relieved to consign the unlucky box
into the small safe in the hall closet.
</p>
<p>
“What a joy to be rid of the thing,” exclaimed
Billie, as they shoved the box inside, turned the
combination lock, and fled downstairs.
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if we need a good dose of fresh air,
Mary, to revive us after that inquisition,” she
added, as they hurried past the company of tea
drinkers, who still lingered chatting in the doorway,
and joined the others in the motor car.
</p>
<p>
“Percival, my son,” called Mrs. St. Clair,
“don’t lean out so far. You might fall and break
your nose. Oh, oh, my precious boy, they’ll kill
him!” she shrieked, as Charlie and Merry seized
him by the arms and pretended to pitch him overboard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—RUMORS AT SCHOOL.</h2>
<p>
West Haven High School, Miss Gray, the
Principal, had often said, had all the merits of
a public and private school combined. It was
more thorough than a private school and the
teachers were more in touch with the pupils than
is usual at a public school. Miss Gray herself
was deeply interested in the welfare of her girls
and studied carefully the ability and temperament
of each one.
</p>
<p>
When, therefore, a strange and very terrible
complaint was made to her one morning about one
of her school girls, she was too shocked to reason
intelligently about it, and ended by dismissing
the complainants quietly from her private office
until she sent for them again.
</p>
<p>
Exactly what the complaint was no one knew
except those who had made it. It was kept a
careful secret. But in school rumors arise in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
the most subtle way. They are whispered about
behind doors at recess; written on the margins of
text books in class and hastily rubbed out;
vaguely hinted at here and there until they spread
from room to room and class to class and gradually
the whole school is bursting with the news.
And the poor victim may all this time be entirely
unconscious that she is the very centre of a seething,
boiling pot of gossip.
</p>
<p>
This is how the present rumor started in West
Haven High School:
</p>
<p>
One afternoon when the last gong had sounded
the sophomore class gathered in the locker
room to put on their coats and hats. The lockers
were only so in name. There had never been
any keys to them, because there had never been
any need to keep belongings under lock and key
in West Haven High School, where most of the
pupils had known each other all their lives.
</p>
<p>
On this particular afternoon, every incident of
which our four friends will remember as long
as they live, Nancy was prinking at the glass,
as usual; Elinor and Billie, with their heads bent
over an automobile map, were making plans for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
a motor trip, and Mary Price was studying her
Latin for the next day. It was that lingering,
lazy time after school is over, which all school
girls know.
</p>
<p>
Fannie Alta hurried into the room and flung
open the door of her locker, next to that of Belle
Rogers, who was at that moment engaged in
looking at herself in her own private mirror,
hung on the inside of her locker door.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” exclaimed Fannie Alta,
with a very excited and strange manner. “I
have lost something. Something which my
mamma gave me to keep for her. What shall I
do? What shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, what was it, Fannie?” asked the other
girls, gathering around her sympathetically.
“Let us help you find it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh, it is terrible!” cried the young Spanish
girl, wringing her hands and weeping in her
handkerchief alternately. “What shall I do?
What shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“Was it money you lost?” asked Billie, in her
usual rather abrupt manner.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes; how did you know?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know, I guessed,” answered Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Did you leave it in your locker?” some one
else asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes. I left it there at noon to-day.
Twenty dollars my mamma gave to me to keep
for her. Oh, is it not terrible? She will eat me
with her anger.”
</p>
<p>
Billie could hardly keep the corners of her
mouth from curving with an irrepressible smile
when she remembered those two front tusks of
Mme. Alta’s, which seemed to be uncovered,
ready for work at any moment.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure it is not there still?” asked Elinor
quietly. “I happened to look up when you
came into the room. You simply flung open your
locker door and then began to cry. Why don’t
you look in your pockets before you decide that
you have lost the money?”
</p>
<p>
Fannie flashed an angry glance at Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“How did you know that I had not looked before;
that I have not looked twice, many times?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t,” answered Elinor. “Have you?”
</p>
<p>
Fannie did not reply and from that moment she
and Elinor disliked each other intensely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
Then the girls began looking carefully about
the room.
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if I had it hidden about me,” said
Nancy, giggling, as she helped in the search.
</p>
<p>
The others laughed, too, which somewhat relieved
the situation. Nothing is more uncomfortable
than for money to be lost mysteriously
in a company of people.
</p>
<p>
“We do look as guilty as the forty thieves,”
ejaculated Rosomond McLane, a fat, funny girl,
who was popular with the whole class.
</p>
<p>
No one was more active in the search than
Belle Rogers. She shook Fannie’s text books
violently and scattered the papers about, to Fannie’s
intense annoyance. She felt in Fannie’s
pockets, examined the lining of her hat, and
made herself so officious and numerous that Fannie
herself exclaimed with much irritation:
</p>
<p>
“Please do not, Belle. You know it is not
there.”
</p>
<p>
Only Elinor sat quietly on the window sill
watching the search, with just the faintest
shadow of scornful incredulity on her handsome
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Elinor Butler, do you believe I have been telling
a falsehood?” Fannie finally exclaimed in exasperation.
</p>
<p>
“What a little spitfire you are, Fannie,” answered
Elinor. “Just because I don’t choose to
grovel on the floor looking for your money. I
can help you quite as much by thinking, and I am
thinking very hard, I can assure you.”
</p>
<p>
At last the search was abandoned. The pocketbook
containing the money could not be found,
and the young girls, swinging their book straps,—bags
were too childish for High School girls,—strolled
up the street in groups discussing the
strange disappearance of Fannie’s twenty dollars.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the Motor Maids, laughing
and talking together, tossed their books into the
red car and then climbed in themselves. Somehow,
Fannie’s loss did not seem very real. Billie
had cranked up the machine and was about to
back out when Fannie’s voice called from the
locker room:
</p>
<p>
“Wait! Stop!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see we haven’t gone yet,” answered
Elinor severely.
</p>
<p>
“Elinor, you are so hard on Fannie Alta. I’m
sorry for her,” said Mary. “Mother wouldn’t
bite me if I lost twenty dollars, but I’d hate to
lose it just the same.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t mean to be hard on her,” answered
Elinor, “but my instincts tell me not to trust
her.”
</p>
<p>
“When did they tell you, Elinor?” laughed
Billie.
</p>
<p>
Elinor’s instincts were a great joke to her
three devoted friends. But the appearance of
Fannie running breathlessly, with Belle following
at a dignified pace, interrupted Elinor’s invariable
reply to jests about her instincts: “You know
they are never wrong.”
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter now, Fannie?” asked
Billie, who was standing in the front of her car,
her arms folded, like a captain on the hurricane
deck of his ship.
</p>

<span class='caption'>“Get out of the road,” cried Billie, backing recklessly out<br/>of the shed and whizzing out of the gate at full speed.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>
“Would you mind——” Fannie stammered. “I
mean—I think I have a right to ask—I want you
to look in your pockets. I believe——” she
continued, getting bolder every moment. “I am sure
that one of you will find my pocketbook——”
</p>
<p>
Billie’s frank, candid face flushed as scarlet as
her motor car, while the color left Elinor’s cheeks
as white as death. Nancy gave a little frightened
giggle, and Mary Price neither flushed nor
turned white, but looked quietly on.
</p>
<p>
“Really, Fannie,” spoke Elinor, “you are not
in the lawless South American country you came
from, whatever it is. You are among decent people,
not thieves, and perhaps you had better remember
that hereafter. Start on, Billie,” she
commanded, sitting as erect as a queen at her own
coronation.
</p>
<p>
“But I insist!” screamed Fannie.
</p>
<p>
“She has a right,” put in Belle.
</p>
<p>
“Get out of the road,” cried Billie, backing
recklessly out of the shed, turning with a wide,
flourishing curve and whizzing out of the gate
at full speed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all the insolence,” cried Elinor.
“What does she mean and how does she dare——” her
voice choked with indignation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think it was Belle Rogers who put
her up to it out of revenge?” suggested Mary.
</p>
<p>
“If it was, I can’t see what she had to gain by
it,” said Billie. “Elinor sailed into them and we
nearly sailed over them. It seems to me we had a
good deal the best of it.”
</p>
<p>
Billie dropped the girls at their homes, as she
was in the habit of doing every afternoon after
school, and whirled up Cliff Street to the old
Campbell homestead. On the way she passed
Belle Rogers, who also lived in that fashionable
section, but she did not ask her to get in and
ride up the hill. Billie had a frank, open nature,
but with her whole soul she distrusted that pink
and white doll-baby face and those innocent
china blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime Mary had taken off her rather
threadbare little jacket and hung it in the closet.
Her mother was resting on the couch. She looked
pale and tired that day, and Mary walked softly
so as not to disturb her. Slipping off her mittens,
she thrust them into her coat pocket. Her
fingers encountered something and she pulled out
a flat, foreign-looking pocketbook. Mary’s face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
turned white and she leaned against the wall of
the closet and closed her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“They must have put it in my pocket,” she
whispered. “What shall I do?”
</p>
<p>
“Mary, dearest,” called her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother,” she answered, quietly slipping
the purse into the pocket again. “I won’t tell
her now,” she thought. “She is worried enough
already.” And when presently she kissed her
mother, no one could have told that the young
girl was more frightened than she had ever been
in all her lifetime.
</p>
<p>
The next morning Mary hurried to school
without waiting for Billie and her car. She had
something to study, she said. But Fannie was
there before her, waiting in the locker room.
Mary tried to calm her beating heart as she
looked steadily at the other girl. Then, with a
sudden resolution, she marched straight up to
Fannie, and thrust the pocketbook into her hand.
</p>
<p>
“You put this in my pocket,” she said. “I
don’t know what you have against me, or what
I ever did to you, but if you ever do it again, I
shall go straight to Miss Gray.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
Fannie took the pocketbook without a word,
and after that a very different version of the
story got out. Finally it reached Miss Gray’s
ears.
</p>
<p>
But the most serious thing of all was that
things began disappearing every day out of the
girls’ lockers.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—SEVEN LEAGUE ISLAND.</h2>
<p>
“Pile in any old way and make yourselves as
comfy as you can,” said Billie, from the chauffeur’s
seat, while seven boys and girls packed
themselves into “The Comet” as tightly as sardines
in a box.
</p>
<p>
“Ben, I look to you to take good care of my
girls,” called Miss Helen Campbell, from the
front door steps of her home. “And all of you
promise me three things: Don’t go too fast;
don’t stay too late, and don’t go too far.”
</p>
<p>
“We promise,” came eight voices in a chorus.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, Cousin Helen, dearest,” called Billie,
kissing her hand affectionately to the little lady
who was fast coming to fill an aching void in
Billie’s heart.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, Miss Campbell,” called the others,
while she smiled and bowed and waved her handkerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
like a favorite actress before an enthusiastic
audience.
</p>
<p>
What a difference the young people had made
in her life, she thought, as the carload of boys
and girls flashed down the street and the sound
of their talk and laughter, growing fainter and
fainter, floated back to her like a pleasant memory.
</p>
<p>
It was a real seaside October day. Nothing
could have been bluer than the bay, unless it was
the sky. A warm, dry land breeze swept over
the moors about West Haven. Wild asters and
golden rod colored the roadside, and the stillness
of Indian summer pervaded the whole country.
</p>
<p>
“There was no need of the top to-day,” observed
Billie, looking up at the cloudless sky. “I
am glad we decided not to put it on. We might
as well have left the rugs and wraps behind, too.
They take up room and won’t be used, I am certain.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope not,” answered Ben. “I see only one
cloud on the horizon and that’s no larger than a
man’s hand; but clouds do grow.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t borrow trouble, Rain-in-the-Face,” exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
Percy. “The last time you looked into
the future we had a fire.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, dummy,” answered his friend. “I
am not predicting anything. I only mentioned the
possibilities of a very small cloud. And the night
of the Shell Island fire I said what certainly
proved to be perfectly true—that the hotel was a
regular fire trap.”
</p>
<p>
“Are you really a good weather prophet, Ben?”
asked Billie anxiously. She did not like to have
her parties turn out disastrously.
</p>
<p>
“He—he’s the poorest ever,” cried Merry.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go on what he says, Billie,” put in
Percy. “The last camping trip we went on, he
predicted fair weather and it rained for a week.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, just to prove that I know what I’m
talking about,” cried Ben, “I predict that it rains
before night.”
</p>
<p>
This unpopular prophecy was greeted by hoots
of derision from the others.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think so, Ben?” asked Elinor.
“It’s as clear as a bell now.”
</p>
<p>
“Certain signs,” he answered.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Ben Austen,” ejaculated Nancy. “Don’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
go spoil our day before it’s begun. You know
just as well as I do that it’s Indian summer, and
it never rains in Indian summer.”
</p>
<p>
“Never, Miss Nancy-Bell?” repeated Ben,
smiling. He minded as little being teased by his
friends as a big, good-natured dog minds the
antics of a lot of puppies.
</p>
<p>
“All right, Big Injun Ben,” said Merry, “let
it rain before night. We’ve got a good many
hours to enjoy ourselves in and get home, too, before
dark. We’ll be at the ferry-boat landing in
an hour, and if we’re lucky enough to catch the
boat, we’ll reach Seven League Island by eleven
o’clock. That will give us plenty of time to eat
everything in sight, see Smugglers’ Cave, and all
the other sights, and get home by seven o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we can,” replied Ben. “I was only
teasing Percival Algernon St. Clair, because he
hates the rain worse than poison. I never saw a
finer day in my life.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness!” exclaimed Billie, in tones
of relief. She really had great faith in Ben’s
judgment about most things.
</p>
<p>
Seven League Island, a rocky strip of land some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
twenty-one miles long, was one of the most romantic
places in the vicinity of West Haven. It
was three miles from the mainland and, during
the season when the summer resorts and camps
which clustered on its shores were open, several
ferry-boats carried passengers back and forth
from the mainland to the island. In winter the
place was almost deserted. The land was too
poor for farming and few people cared to remain
on that lonely, mournful island, where, in stormy
weather, the waves thundered through the caves
in the cliffs, and the wind in the pine trees made
a mournful sound like the wail of a lost soul.
</p>
<p>
To-day, however, it was as serene and smiling
as the Islands of the Blest. The southwest wind
stirred the pine needles gently, making a pleasant
quiet song. The tiny waves, as they lapped
the sides of the ferry, gave out a “cloop, cloop”
sound that still water makes against the bow of
a canoe.
</p>
<p>
“What time does the last ferry go back, Captain?”
asked Ben, of the old ferryman, whose
face was as weather beaten and seamed as the
hide of a hippopotamus.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“Six, in good weather.”
</p>
<p>
“What time in bad?”
</p>
<p>
“Depends on the weather,” answered the old
man briefly.
</p>
<p>
“How many other ferry stations are there?”
asked Charlie.
</p>
<p>
“Three.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” exclaimed happy-go-lucky Americus
Brown. “We’ll take the one that’s nearest when
the time comes to go back and ride before the
wind, and beat the rain and put old Ben out of
business as a weather prophet.”
</p>
<p>
The ferryman said nothing, but his small eyes
twinkled with amusement.
</p>
<p>
They were the only passengers on the boat that
trip, and as the motor whirled up the hard-beaten
road from the ferry landing, they noticed that
the bungalows and summer cottages along the
shore were closed for the season.
</p>
<p>
“It’s because it’s so hard to get food,” Percy
explained. He had once visited some friends
at Flag Point, the first settlement, and was to be
their guide this morning to the great cave, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
had been used, it was said, in the days when
smugglers were common in the land.
</p>
<p>
The others were familiar only with the shore,
where they had come on bathing and fishing excursions,
and the boys and girls were eager to
explore the rocky caverns, the fort, the little inlets,
where pirates were supposed to have anchored
their ships, and above all the smugglers’
cave, which Percy told them was a great vaulted
chamber in the rocks, with an entrance no broader
than a narrow door.
</p>
<p>
“Take the road going to the right,” called
Percy, as Billie paused at the top of the cliff for
directions. “It’s the best one for motoring and
it goes past the old rifle-pit where we can eat
lunch. We can leave the car there and climb
down to the caves afterwards.”
</p>
<p>
“The Comet” turned obediently to the right
and shot down the interminable expanse of empty
white road, like a shooting star on the milky way.
</p>
<p>
Even Mary, who had been pale and silent all
morning, regained her spirits on that glorious
ride, when Merry, with head thrown back, began
to sing:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The sailor’s wife the sailor’s star shall be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yo-ho, yo-ho-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho-ho!”<br />
</p>
<p>
and she joined in the chorus with the others, her
clear, sweet voice piping out like the notes of a
field lark in a chorus of birds.
</p>
<p>
At last Billie pulled up at the side of the road
under a cliff, on top of which was an old grass-grown
fort used during the Indian wars.
</p>
<p>
“This must be it,” she said. “It’s peaceful
enough looking now to make a good picnicing
ground, but I don’t suppose it was much of a picnic
for the people who built it to shoot Indians
from.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor much of a picnic for the Indians, either,”
said Ben, helping Billie out while Charlie Clay
assisted the other girls to the ground and Percy
and Merry unstrapped the luncheon hamper.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s eat up high,” suggested Billie. “That is,
if you can carry the basket up that steep incline.”
</p>
<p>
“The pack mules are here for that work,” said
Ben, pointing to Merry and Percy. “Charlie, you
bring the rugs for the ladies to sit on and I’ll
help the ladies.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“Will you listen to Nervy Nat,” cried Percy,
as he obediently shouldered his end of the luncheon
hamper and followed Merry up the hill.
</p>
<p>
How they laughed and scrambled and shoved
as they clambered up the pebbly path. Once
Mary, with a shrill cry, slipped and stumbled
back on Nancy who fell against Charlie, who, in
his turn, tumbled against Ben, and that pillar of
strength, grasping a branch of a pine tree with
each hand, supported the whole human weight
without a tremor.
</p>
<p>
It was like picnicing in the tops of the trees,
when they finally spread the cloth in the grass-grown
enclosure of the fort, and beyond them
stretched the entire expanse of the ocean glimmering
blue in the sunshine, with an occasional
ship outlined on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
“I hope the ginger ale is still cold,” cried
Merry.
</p>
<p>
“And the mayonnaise hasn’t melted,” said
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“What, nothing to eat but victuals and drink?”
exclaimed Percy.
</p>
<p>
When they had waded through the piles of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
sandwiches and pyramids of cake, and drained
the last drop of ginger ale, silent Charlie, who had
an enormous appetite, remarked:
</p>
<p>
“How hungry this piney-salty combination does
make a fellow!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Charlie,” said Billie, “don’t say you are
still hungry. You remind me of the elephant in
Merry’s song:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘The elephant ate all night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elephant ate all day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feed as they would, as much as they could,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cry was still more hay.’”<br />
</p>
<p>
Charlie pulled out his mouth organ and began
to play such a rollicking dance tune that the boys
and girls, almost before they knew it, were two-stepping
over the grass as madly as a lot of wild
young colts. Then Charlie, seizing Mary about
the waist and still playing vigorously on his
“harp,” as it was called in that section, joined the
dancers himself.
</p>
<p>
If they had not all of them been so absorbed in
executing the Dutch twirl, or racing over the
ground like Cossack dancers on the Russian
Steppes, they would have been somewhat disturbed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
have seen a man peering down at them
from the top of a mound. He had crawled up the
steep incline and was lying flat on his stomach in
the tall grass. His face is familiar enough to us
by now, for he had only one eye, but that one, like
the eye of the three mythological witches, gleamed
brilliantly and wickedly and nothing escaped its
range. He smiled as if he rather enjoyed watching
the dancers, and especially his one wicked eye
followed the movements of Ben and Charlie and
Billie Campbell. Presently when the whirling
couples had tumbled breathlessly on the grass,
fanning themselves with their hats and Ben had
called out: “We’d better be getting along now,”
the man slipped away as silently as a snake and
disappeared somewhere below.
</p>
<p>
“To the caves,” cried Percy, as they gathered
up the rugs and cushions and hastened down the
cliff to the motor.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose it’s safe to leave ‘The Comet’ here
without any one to look after him,” Billie had observed,
and the others had agreed that it was.
</p>
<p>
“As safe as on any other desert island,” Ben
had answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
It seemed impossible that anything could happen
in that lonely, quiet place, which was like a
deserted paradise to the girls and boys that beautiful
afternoon. There was nothing about the locality
or the weather to arouse uncomfortable
suspicions. The patch of sky, which was revealed
to them just overhead between the tall,
straight pine trees, was like a beautiful deep
blue canopy. Even the watchful Ben could not
have told that the cloud, so short a time ago no
larger than a man’s hand, now stretched itself
across the horizon in a long, thick line of black.
</p>
<p>
“The caves are the most fun of all,” said Percy,
leading the way to the cliffs overlooking the
ocean. “There are dozens of them, some little
and some very large. The lower ones fill up at
high tide, but the upper ones are safe enough.”
</p>
<p>
The cliff was honeycombed with small rocky
chambers, and as they clambered, Indian file,
along the narrow path which nature had so
thoughtfully cut in the rocks they heard the
boom of the incoming tide thundering through
the caves on the beach.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose people could live in these little caverns,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
Percy continued, “if it wasn’t so all-fired
lonely and inconvenient; but wait until you see
Smugglers’ Cave. It has as many natural conveniences
as a real house built by human beings.”
</p>
<p>
“Here it is,” he cried at last, to the others who
had run all the way down a steep embankment to
see this romantic place.
</p>
<p>
Certainly it might well have been a favorite
spot for smugglers and robbers on the high seas.
Too high for the tide to reach and still well hidden
from above by a thick growth of scrubby
pine and oak trees, the cave was as secret and
safe a place as could be imagined. Rock-hewn
steps led up from the smooth pebbly beach
below and the curve of the coast made a charming
little haven for ships and a natural landing
place for small boats. The eight friends stood in
a row on the beach.
</p>
<p>
“This is called ‘Pirates’ Cove,’ you know,” went
on Percy. “They say the pirates used to anchor
their ships in this little haven and come ashore
and have pirate tea parties on the beach.”
</p>
<p>
“Here comes a sea rover now,” called Merry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
scanning the entrance to the harbor where a
ship could be seen outlined against the blue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she isn’t coming this way, Old Tar,” answered
Percy. “It’s too late in the season, for
yachts and ships rarely come in here unless there
is a storm. There’s nothing to come for and it
takes them out of their course.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s headed this way,” continued Merry, not
taking any notice of Percy’s interruption, while
he scanned the ship with his far-seeing sailor’s
eyes. “She’s a brigantine, and she’s making for
this cove.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, what of it?” put in Billie. “Perhaps
she is coming here for the rest cure. But
she doesn’t interest me half as much as Smugglers’
Cave. Let’s not waste any more time
here,” and she ran up the steps, followed by the
others.
</p>
<p>
The entrance to the cave had been as cleverly
concealed as if nature had conspired with the
outlaws to provide them with a safe hiding place
for their contraband goods. The steps appeared
to lead to nothing more than a blank wall, but,
following Percy around the edge of an enormous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
rock which, in ages past must have slipped its
fastenings above, they presently came to a narrow
opening between the rock and the side of the
cave, just large enough for a man to go through.
</p>
<p>
“The smugglers must have had to do up their
bales of silk pretty flat to get them through
here,” said Ben, measuring the opening with his
handkerchief, as he stooped to keep from bumping
his head on the top.
</p>
<p>
“How beautiful! How wonderful!” cried the
four girls, when their eyes had become used to the
change from the brilliant sunlight outside to the
semi-twilight of the great vaulted chamber where
they now found themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I’ll show you what a jim-dandy architect
nature is,” said Percy. “Here’s the bathroom.
No hot water, of course, but a perfectly
good tub and cold water always on tap.”
</p>
<p>
He pointed out a natural basin, probably worn
in the rocks by the constant dripping of water
from a spring that trickled down the wall of the
cave.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s the bedroom, that nice, comfortable
shelf over there. Here’s your easy chair,” he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
continued, showing them a curious formation of
rocks really resembling a big armchair with a
high back.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a rocky chair and not a rocking chair,”
observed Charlie, taking a seat and rising quite
suddenly. “Nature is as mischievous as a little
boy if she is a good architect. Look at this,”
and he pointed to a very sharp, almost needle-like,
piece of stone in one corner of the seat.
</p>
<p>
The others laughed gayly as they hurried after
Percy and a hundred reverberating echoes
startled them into silence.
</p>
<p>
“And now, ladies and gentlemen, I have saved
the most interesting sight for the last. You are
about to see the store-room of the smugglers.”
He led the way down two steps into another
chamber.
</p>
<p>
“By Jove!” he cried suddenly and stopped
short.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” exclaimed the others, peering
over his shoulder into the darkness.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you see?” he said, in a low voice.
“They are still using it for a store-room.”
</p>
<p>
They blinked their eyes with amazement, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
presently there loomed up in the shadows a pile
of long, flat packing boxes.
</p>
<p>
Ben lit a candle, which he had thoughtfully
brought along in his coat pocket, and they examined
the boxes, which crowded one entire end of
the smugglers’ store-room.
</p>
<p>
“Will you look at this?” he called. “Elinor,
you are in this.”
</p>
<p>
Ben held the candle high and pointed to a
sign on the nearest box, which read: “Automobile
Supplies—Butler Brothers—West Haven——”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” cried Elinor, “you surely don’t suppose
Uncle Tom and Uncle Richard could be
storing their goods here, do you?”
</p>
<p>
No one answered her for a moment. Their
thoughts were busy searching for an explanation
to this strange discovery.
</p>
<p>
“Elinor,” said Mary presently, “don’t you remember
what those men who borrowed Billie’s
automobile said about killing every Butler in the
county who interfered?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Elinor, in a frightened voice, “but
what could these boxes have to do with it?”
</p>
<p>
“They may have a great deal,” said Ben.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
“Those men are probably smuggling your
uncles’ auto supplies out of the country. The
boxes are smuggled up to this cave by degrees, I
suppose, and then loaded on some ship when they
have got enough to make it worth while. And, if
it’s the same man we had dealings with that
night, he is a pretty desperate kind of an individual.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want any more fights,” exclaimed
Billie. “Both of those men carried pistols and
knives; I suppose all first-class smugglers do, but
I don’t propose that my party is going to be
ruined by any bloodshed. It is getting late, and
we had better be going.”
</p>
<p>
They quite agreed with Billie, although the
boys would have liked to linger in the Smugglers’
Cave for a while.
</p>
<p>
The outer air seemed very warm and oppressive
after the cold damp atmosphere of the cave.
They blinked their eyes and shivered as they hurried
along the path which led to the road and in
the change from dark to light they did not at
first notice that the sun was hidden by a great
cloud, as black as ink, which stretched from horizon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
to horizon. A hot, heavy wind stirred the
pine needles and that sense of impending trouble
which always comes before a great storm sobered
the spirits of the boys and girls.
</p>
<p>
Nobody spoke of the cloud. It seemed to be
a question of honor with them not to mention it,
but they hurried on silently, and in a few minutes
reached the automobile.
</p>
<p>
With a sigh of relief, the four girls were about
to jump in, while Ben cranked up, when suddenly
Nancy gave a little, pent-up scream.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” she cried, pointing to a piece of paper
stuck on the cushion of the back seat.
</p>
<p>
This message was printed with a lead pencil
on the paper:
</p>
<p>
“He laughs best who laughs last.”
</p>
<p>
“It was that man,” said Billie, examining the
tires ruefully, each one of which had been slashed
with a sharp knife.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—THE STORM.</h2>
<p>
“Billie, can you put on new tires?” demanded
Ben, somewhat anxiously, making a mental determination
to learn all about the mechanism of
motor cars before he went on another motor trip.
</p>
<p>
The others stood back rather helplessly. Merry,
especially, felt stupid and uncomfortable in having
to stand aside and let a girl do all the work.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I can,” replied Billie, trying to
speak cheerfully, as a low cannonading of thunder
rumbled in the distance. “I have done it
dozens of times, only it will take time, of course.
The tools are under the seat. Hustle up, everybody.
Charlie, you get the new tires. Ben, you
help me.”
</p>
<p>
In a few moments Ben and Billie were kneeling
on the ground adjusting the tire of the first
wheel, while Charlie and Merry were engaged
in examining the extra tires, which the motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
carried in case of accident, and Percy made himself
as useful as possible, unpacking all the wraps,
Billie’s oilskin coat and cap and the rubber
blankets.
</p>
<p>
“Billie,” announced Charlie, “there are only
three good tires here. The fourth has a puncture.
It’s only a small one, but——”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” interrupted Billie, looking extremely
worried. “It was an imperfect one. I may be
able to patch it.”
</p>
<p>
Then Charlie and Merry held a whispered conference
and disappeared around the bluff.
</p>
<p>
“What’s up?” asked Ben, looking over his
shoulder at their retreating figures.
</p>
<p>
But nobody could answer the question. The
girls were getting into their ulsters and Percy
was arranging the rubber blankets and rugs in
the car.
</p>
<p>
“What a confoundedly low, mean trick of that
fellow to do this,” he kept saying to himself, keeping
one eye on the black clouds piling up and the
other on Billie and Ben. He figured that it
would take an hour and a half at least to get all
four tires on and, he thought, Billie would be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
pretty smart girl to do it that quickly. It was
half-past three o’clock.
</p>
<p>
“What about that ferry,” he said to himself.
</p>
<p>
At last they were pumping up the third tire. It
seemed an age to those who were idly looking on.
The girls sat in a row on the side of the road,
their hands folded patiently in their laps, while
Percy paced up and down, watching the top of
the bluff uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“Where are Charlie and Merry?” he said at
last, unable to conceal his anxiety any longer.
</p>
<p>
“Idiots,” exclaimed Nancy. “Haven’t we
enough to worry us?”
</p>
<p>
While she spoke there came a blinding flash of
lightning and a clap of thunder seemed to split
the heavens in two.
</p>
<p>
Nancy hid her face on Elinor’s shoulder.
Billie and Ben kept on working steadily. They
had reached the fourth tire now and Billie had
managed to patch the punctured place just as
the first great drops of rain began to fall.
</p>
<p>
“Where are those boys?” Ben called over his
shoulder, not stopping to look up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll call them,” said Percy, and running to the
top of the cliff he began to halloo and whistle.
</p>
<p>
It had grown suddenly so dark that they
thought the sun must have set an hour earlier
than usual. A cold wind sprang up and whizzed
through the pines with a sound that made them
shiver.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah, it’s done!” cried Billie triumphantly,
just as a driving wall of rain struck her in the
face. “Get in, girls, quick,” she shouted, as she
slipped on her oil skins. “Boys, where are you?
Crank up, Ben.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, in the midst of the din and racket of
the storm, came a wild halloo. Charlie and Merry
appeared, running down the road toward the motor
car, and six men were following them, shouting
and gesticulating.
</p>
<p>
“Get in as fast as you can,” commanded Ben,
and the girls will never forget the terror of that
moment as they tumbled into the car.
</p>
<p>
The booming of the sea in the caves, the cannonading
of the thunder, the sharp whistle of the
wind in the tops of the trees, and the shouts of
the men! But in the midst of it all came the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
kindly, cheering whir of the motor engine. Billie
could have kissed the faithful “Comet” on his
broad, good-natured forehead for his loyalty at
this moment, when they most needed him. As
Charlie and Merry leaped onto the step, she threw
in the clutch, and they were off just as the first
man reached the car, brandishing a long knife
and yelling hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
The boys climbed over into the back, too tired
to speak. Merry had a black eye and Charlie had
a bloody nose.
</p>
<p>
“Billie, the next ferry is Payne’s,” called Percy.
“It’s about a mile from here. Go straight ahead.”
</p>
<p>
And Billie, sticking to her wheel like a good
pilot, ducked her head and guided the flying motor
along the slippery road.
</p>
<p>
They seemed hardly to have taken breath before
they reached Payne’s landing and found it
empty and deserted of every human being who
had ever ventured into that lonely place.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to try for the next ferry landing
then,” said Percy, dejectedly. “It’s back toward
Flag Point.”
</p>
<p>
Without a word, Billie turned the car, and putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
on all speed they whizzed through the rain.
At that moment she had only one prayer in her
heart: to pilot her friends safely through the
storm and get them to the ferry landing. There
was no sign of any of their pursuers as they
passed the fort. When at last they reached the
second summer encampment they breathed a sigh
of relief. The ferry boat was docked at the landing
and a man stood under the shed, his hands in
his pockets.
</p>
<p>
Billie drew up at the entrance.
</p>
<p>
“Captain, will you take us on?” called Ben. He
always called boatmen and conductors captain. He
found it pleased them, but this man did not reply
and still stood with his back turned looking out
on the now angry strip of water between Seven
League Island and the mainland.
</p>
<p>
Ben shouted and they all shouted together, but
the man was as unmoved as a wooden statue.
</p>
<p>
“He’s deaf,” said Billie. “Get out and shake
him.”
</p>
<p>
Ben jumped out and shook the man’s shoulder,
who, with a strange guttural sound, turned slowly
around.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“And dumb,” exclaimed Ben, indicating with
violent motions first the automobile and then the
ferry-boat.
</p>
<p>
The deaf mute shook his head and pointed in
the direction of Flag Point. They offered him
money, tried persuasion, threats, prayers, which
he could not hear, and finally ended by dashing
off toward the last ferry.
</p>
<p>
“It’s our only chance,” said Ben, “but we’ll
get over in that if we have to use force.”
</p>
<p>
Meantime, the island, lashed by the storm,
looked bleak and cold, and they wondered they
could ever have admired it at all. Crouched under
the rubber covers, they shivered with chill,
while Billie, on the front seat, Ben and Percy
beside her always on the lookout, with clinched
teeth and hands gripped to the wheel, guided
them through the hurricane. It seemed to her
they must be riding on the very wings of the
wind, and the speedometer announced fifty miles
an hour.
</p>
<p>
As they dashed through the straggling little
street of that forlorn village of Flag Point, the
few indifferent natives who braved the winters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
on the island looked out of their windows in wonder.
It seemed to them that a streak of red lightning
had flashed through the storm.
</p>
<p>
“Cheer up, all of you, our troubles are over,”
called Ben. “The ferry-boat’s at the landing.”
</p>
<p>
The old boat seemed like a haven of rest when
they pulled into the shelter of its alley for wagons
and motor cars.
</p>
<p>
“Captain, why didn’t you tell us that this was
the only ferry running?” demanded Ben of the
wrinkled old man.
</p>
<p>
“Because I don’t never answer questions that
ain’t first been put to me,” replied the laconic
boatman.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t scold him,” said Billie, wiping streams
of water from her face. “Any one who is obliged
to live in a God-forsaken, wretched place like
Seven League Island couldn’t be supposed to have
any human interest. I imagine they all get to be
like their own flinty rocks, hard, sharp, and
ugly.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, bloody nose and blacky eye,” put in
Percy, “it’s about time for you to give an account
of yourselves.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said the others, who had been so
stunned by the fast ride through the storm and
the race for the ferry that they had almost forgotten
what had happened.
</p>
<p>
“When we found,” began Merry, “that one of
the tires had a puncture, Charlie and I thought
we might as well make that low, scoundrelly thief
who slashed the tires pay back with one of those
he had stolen from Mr. Butler. So we chased
over to Smugglers’ Cave, but it took longer than
we had expected, because we had taken the wrong
path and had to crawl around a precipice and
jump over crags like two mountain goats.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t forget to tell that your pirate brigantine
was anchored out in the harbor,” put in
Charlie. “We supposed it was lying up to get
out of the storm, but we had another think coming——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I guess you will all listen to me, next
time,” went on Merry. “That was the most piratical-looking
band of fellows with their knives
and their red handkerchiefs as I ever saw in a
story book. Well, we did get to the cave at last
and found it as empty as it was before. Charlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
had a chisel in his pocket. You know, he is the
human tool box, and with that and a piece of
stone we managed to loosen some of the boards.
But there wasn’t a tire or anything else connected
with an automobile inside the box. You’ll never
guess what the boxes were filled with. Something
about as foreign to a motor car, except in
sound, when a tire bursts, as a caterpillar.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean guns?” demanded Ben.
</p>
<p>
“We certainly do. Rifles by the dozens packed
in all the boxes we had time to open.”
</p>
<p>
“We were chumps,” interrupted Charlie. “If
we had stopped sooner, I never would have had
this bloody nose.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, haven’t I got a black eye?” demanded
his friend.
</p>
<p>
“What happened? What happened?” cried
Percy impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“While we were tinkering with the boxes, we
heard the sharpest, loudest whistle I ever heard in
my life, and we both lit out and ran. I was in
front and just as I got to the mouth of the cave,
a one-eyed, one-armed ruffian leapt out at me.
His one arm was as strong as most men’s two,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
but he couldn’t beat Charlie and me together, although
he gave me this little souvenir and he
planted his fist on Charlie’s nose. While we were
fighting, a boat from the ship with six sailors in
it landed below. They came tearing up the steps
like a lot of bloodhounds, and Charlie and I had
a run for our lives. Didn’t we, midget?”
</p>
<p>
Charlie acknowledged the fact gravely. There
was no denying that the two boys had been in a
very dangerous situation.
</p>
<p>
“We were ready just in the nick of time, too,”
said Billie. “If Ben hadn’t cranked up, we’d
have had those men on us in another minute.”
</p>
<p>
It was good to be on land again, even though it
wasn’t dry land, and the ride home, safe and
swift, was blissful after the dangers and excitement
of that thrilling picnic.
</p>
<p>
It seemed that Seven League Island must have
been the very centre of the hurricane and that
West Haven had only been visited with a heavy
shower. Miss Campbell, therefore, was spared
any great anxiety.
</p>
<p>
But, oh, the joy of drawing up to the cheerful
blaze of the wood fire, while eight youthful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
adventurers related a somewhat softened version
of the events of the day! Then the supper that
followed, in Miss Campbell’s big, old-fashioned
dining room, with fried chicken and hot biscuits
and omelette as light as a feather, and strawberry
jam that took the prize at the county fair!
</p>
<p>
But best of all was what Merry did at the
last, when, notwithstanding his stiff joints and
bandaged eye, he rose from his seat and cried:
</p>
<p>
“Hip, hip, hurrah! Three cheers for Billie,
the pluckiest chauffeur that ever ran a motor
car.”
</p>
<p>
And all the rest joined in, even Miss Campbell,
who clapped her hands and cried:
</p>
<p>
“Three cheers for my dear, dear Billie.”
</p>
<p>
Then Billie cried:
</p>
<p>
“Three cheers for Ben because he never said
‘I told you so,’ about the rain.”
</p>
<p>
That very night, before he went to his own
home, Ben called at Mr. Richard Butler’s house
and told him the story of the bogus automobile
supplies marked with the name of Butler Brothers.
</p>
<p>
There was a great telegraphing and telephoning by long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
distance. The Butler Brothers were
very excited and angry, just as their niece had
predicted they would be. Detectives were engaged
and other ships warned to keep a sharp
lookout, but nothing was heard of the pirate brigantine.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS.</h2>
<p>
Never since she had been Principal of West
Haven High School had Miss Gray been so upset
as she was now. For the first time a scandal
was connected with her beloved institution.
Every day there was a new complaint.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Gray, I only left my ring on the washstand
a minute, while I was washing my hands,
and when I looked for it, it was gone,” said one
girl.
</p>
<p>
“But who was in the washroom, Julia?” asked
the Principal wearily. She was disgusted and
angry with this troublesome situation.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, all the girls, Miss Gray, but nobody saw
any one take it.”
</p>
<p>
Small purses containing lunch money were
emptied of their contents and put back into jacket
pockets. Some of the teachers lost money and
Miss Gray herself was robbed of ten dollars, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
wages of the old janitor, which she had placed
under a paper weight on the desk, in her own
private office.
</p>
<p>
The whole school had gone distracted, but the
pilferer was too clever to be caught.
</p>
<p>
Twice Miss Gray had summoned Mary Price to
her office, but, after looking gravely into the
young girl’s serious eyes, she kissed her and
sent her off on some improvised errand.
</p>
<p>
“I shall wait a few days,” the Principal said.
“After all, there may be some mistake.”
</p>
<p>
And it was then that she determined to try an
experiment.
</p>
<p>
One bleak autumn afternoon a thick, wet mist
rolled in from the ocean and enveloped the town
of West Haven so densely that it seemed like
a city floating on a bank of cloud. Only the dim
outline of objects twenty yards away could be
seen and the muffled call of the fog horn at the
lighthouse on the Black Reefs sounded its dismal
warning through the mist.
</p>
<p>
Billie and Mary were hurrying arm in arm
down the street in earnest conversation. Notwithstanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
it was after school hours, they were
going toward the High School.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think we can get it, Mary?” Billie was
saying.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, the janitor always leaves the door to
the basement corridor open until evening for Miss
Gray and the teachers who sometimes stay late.”
</p>
<p>
“It was stupid of me to have left that horrid
old algebra, but you know I always forget
the things I don’t like. If Miss Finch hadn’t
called me down so thoroughly this morning about
my average in mathematics, I would just let the
lesson for to-morrow go, or if Miss Finch were
only Miss Allbright, or Miss anybody else but
just a stern, animated mathematical cube.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s all right if you know your lessons,” said
Mary, smiling. “It’s only the ones who don’t
study hard enough to suit her who call her a
human arithmetic.”
</p>
<p>
The door to the corridor was open, as Mary
had predicted, and the girls entered, their footsteps
resounding with a hollow echo through the
empty place.
</p>
<p>
“‘I feel like one who treads alone some banquet hall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
deserted,’” quoted Billie. “Could anything
be more ghostly than a deserted school?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not deserted,” said Nancy. “I heard
voices somewhere, I am certain of it, just as you
opened the door.”
</p>
<p>
They paused and listened for a moment, but
the place was as still as a tomb. A dim gas-light
burned in the long corridor, on each side of
which were the arched entrances to the locker
rooms of the various classes, wash rooms and
Miss Gray’s own private office.
</p>
<p>
“It reminds me of the catacombs in this light,”
whispered Billie. “I’m almost afraid of the
sound of my own voice.”
</p>
<p>
The girls slipped silently down the passage to
the stairway leading to the class rooms. At her
desk in the sophomore study room on the third
floor Billie found her algebra. As she gathered
together some of her scattered papers in the not
over tidy interior of the little one-seated desk
form, and searched for a certain favorite stubby
pencil which she claimed brought her good luck
with her problems, Mary at her own desk gave a
cry of dismay and sat down limply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“What was it, a mouse?” asked Billie, her voice
sounding quite loud in the empty room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Billie, Billie, no, it was not a mouse. It
was fifty dollars,” cried Mary. “I found it just
now in my desk.”
</p>
<p>
“Fifty dollars?” echoed Billie, slipping her algebra
into her pocket and hurrying over to her
friend’s desk. “Are you playing a trick on me,
Mary?”
</p>
<p>
“Listen, Billie,” said Mary. “I’m going to tell
you something. I believe I am the victim of
some kind of conspiracy. You know of course
about all of the things that have been stolen from
school lately?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I haven’t had any losses myself; so
I haven’t talked about it much to the others.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you had no idea that I was supposed
to be the thief,” Mary went on, with a sort
of dry sob in her voice that was more heart-breaking
to Billie than real weeping would have been.
</p>
<p>
Mary told her the story of Fannie Alta and the
twenty dollars.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t tell it before,” she continued, “because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
I was so ashamed somehow, I couldn’t bear for
any one to know it.”
</p>
<p>
Billie’s heart swelled with indignation.
</p>
<p>
“The little wretch,” she exclaimed, “you should
have gone straight to Miss Gray about it, Mary.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, and I am sorry now I didn’t, but I
thought she wouldn’t dare do it again, and she
hasn’t, but things are disappearing all the time,
and I believe she has told it around school that
I took the twenty dollars and all the other things.
Nobody has said anything, of course, but I can’t
help feeling that they are all whispering about
me whenever my back is turned.”
</p>
<p>
“You poor, blessed child,” exclaimed her
friend. “And all this time you have been keeping
it secret and suffering in silence.”
</p>
<p>
Mary nodded her head.
</p>
<p>
“And the worst of it is, Miss Gray suspects
me too. But she is not going to say anything
until she is sure. I thought of talking to her
about it, but it would look as if I had a guilty
conscience to complain before I am accused.”
</p>
<p>
“How dare any one suspect you of stealing,”
cried Billie, putting her arms around her friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
and kissing her warmly. “Would Miss Gray or
any one else be so stupid as to take the word of
Fannie Alta before yours?”
</p>
<p>
“But nobody has said anything that I know
of,” groaned poor Mary. “It’s all in the air.
That is why I don’t know what to do. Suppose
after all I was mistaken and they didn’t suspect
me. Suppose I took this money to Miss Gray
and suppose she would think that I had taken all
the other things and was just returning this because
I had lost my nerve and suppose—suppose——”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mary,” remonstrated Billie, “why suppose
anything at all so awful? Why not suppose
that Miss Gray will listen to you and believe every
word you say. You are perfectly innocent and
nothing on earth can make you guilty. Of
course Fannie Alta must have left the money in
your desk, though where she got so much is a
mystery to me.”
</p>
<p>
“But I tell you I am frightened, Billie. Such
wretched things do happen and innocent people
often suffer for guilty ones.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense, Mary, you must not lose your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
nerve in this way. Take the money and go
straight to Miss Gray with it now. I will go
with you.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls gathered their things together
silently. Mary put the roll of money in her
jacket pocket and they made for the door. It was
almost dark now and the rows of empty desks
down the big room were like kneeling phantoms
in the half light.
</p>
<p>
“Did you hear anything?” whispered Mary as
they reached the door.
</p>
<p>
“I heard a step,” answered Billie in a low
voice. “It was probably the janitor.”
</p>
<p>
With a mutual impulse they clasped hands and
a wave of fear swept over them when they found
that the door would not open.
</p>
<p>
“It must have stuck,” whispered Mary. “Try
it again.”
</p>
<p>
But the door was locked fast.
</p>
<p>
“There is only one way for you to get back
the key to the door, young ladies,” said a voice
so near to them that they both jumped back as
if they had been struck in the face.
</p>
<p>
The person who had spoken had been standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
flat against the wall at the side of the door. He
emerged from the shadows, as quietly as a
shadow itself, and in the twilight his long, lank
figure seemed almost to be floating in space. The
small black mask which covered his face and his
whole appearance reminded Billie of a gruesome
picture she had once seen called “The Black
Masque.”
</p>
<p>
“You have a small sum of money there,” he
went on, “which you evidently do not wish to
keep and which I would be pleased to have and
can use at once. By a strange coincidence, I happened
to overhear your conversation, you see, and
as the money appears to belong to nobody and
is exactly the sum I require I must have it.”
</p>
<p>
Mary tried to speak, but her lips refused to
form the words, and she had no voice left. There
was a sound in Billie’s ears like the pounding of
surf on the beach and she felt quite dizzy.
</p>
<p>
“This is fright,” she found herself saying, as
a wave of homesickness for her father swept over
her.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, papa, papa,” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
The man had seized Mary’s two hands in one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
of his with a grip of steel, while with the other
he felt in her jacket pocket, took the roll of
money, pushed Billie roughly from the door, and
with a laugh pulled back the bolt; there had been
no key after all. The next instant he had slipped
downstairs as softly as a cat and was gone.
</p>
<p>
The girls followed after him like two sleep
walkers.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been robbed, Billie,” moaned Mary,
giving her dry sob. “The fifty dollars is gone.
What shall we do now?”
</p>
<p>
Billie did not reply. She wanted to get out of
that dark stuffy school building, and breathe in
some fresh air before she dared trust her voice.
It was good to feel the wet fog again in their
faces as they hurried up the street.
</p>
<p>
“Why not still tell Miss Gray, Mary?” asked
Billie at last, but already there was a feeling of
doubt in her heart. It was certainly a very unlikely
sounding story, a robber in the school room.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly a figure loomed up in the mist. It
was Miss Gray herself.
</p>
<p>
“You are out late, girls,” she said as she hurried
past, and for some reason they both had an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
uncomfortable feeling of having done something
wrong.
</p>
<p>
Miss Gray hastened into the school building
just as the janitor appeared to lock up.
</p>
<p>
“Jennings,” she said, “switch on the light in
the sophomore study room. I shall only be there
a moment.”
</p>
<p>
The janitor shuffled after her and turned on
the light while Miss Gray opened Mary’s desk.
She sighed deeply and shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“She must have got here before me,” she
thought. “It was cruel to tempt the child at
such a time as this when her mother is in great
need of money. I felt so sure she would bring
it straight to me and that was the only test I required.
Oh, dear, what a crooked world this is.
I am out fifty dollars. But how will the poor
child ever explain all this money to her mother?
She must have saved a good deal out of her pilfering——”
</p>
<p>
Miss Gray’s disconnected train of thought did
not bring her any comfort, as she slowly descended
the three flights of steps into the basement
and plunged into the mist again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
“At least I shall wait a day or two,” she continued.
“The child may think better of it. She
might have stopped me this evening, though.
At all events I deserve to lose the money. It
was a silly, stupid impulse, but I was so sure—so
very sure——”
</p>
<p>
The mist had grown so thick now that the
Principal walked very slowly, keeping close to the
fence in order to guide herself to the corner
where she must turn to go to her own home. A
voice reached her through the fog. Someone
was coming up from behind.
</p>
<p>
“I have procured fifty, Señor, a curious lucky
stroke, and from a schoolroom, too—would you
have believed——” the voice broke off in a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful——” said another voice, and two
figures passed Miss Gray in the fog and were
swallowed up again immediately.
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible,” she exclaimed, “robbers in
West Haven High School? What does it mean?
And I have been blaming that innocent child.
What an imbecile I have been!”
</p>
<p>
Her last resolution before sleep came to her
that night was to notify the town police in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
morning and hire a detective to stay about the
High School day and night.
</p>
<p>
Imagine the surprise of the bewildered Principal,
when, next morning bright and early, Mary
Price, after a timid knock on the office door, came
hesitatingly into the room.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Gray,” she said, “I found this money
yesterday afternoon in my desk. I don’t know
how it came there nor whose it is. But it would
be better for you to take charge of it until the
owner asks for it.”
</p>
<p>
Mary spoke quickly, as if she had learned the
little speech carefully by heart. There was a
strange expression on Miss Gray’s face as she
took ten crisp new five-dollar bills from the young
girl’s outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>
“This is not even the same money,” she
thought, forgetting to answer Mary in her
amazement. “Am I losing my senses or is the
child a deep dyed villain?”
</p>
<p>
Mary flushed scarlet under the Principal’s
steady gaze, but she did not lower her eyes, and
there was not a sign of guilt in the expression of
the sad little face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
“Very well, dear,” Miss Gray said at last.
</p>
<p>
Mary, as she closed the door behind her, was
more mystified than Miss Gray.
</p>
<p>
“I should think she would have shown a little
surprise,” she said.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—THE HALLOWE’EN HOUSE PARTY.</h2>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>My Dear Miss Campbell:</span>
</p>
<p>
Do you think your nice young charge would
be bored by a visit to our lonely old home in the
country? Percival has set his heart on giving
a Hallowe’en house party for some of his particular
friends, and I find Wilhelmina’s name the
very first on the list. I shall promise to look
after her in every way exactly as if she were my
own child, guard her from draughts, see that she
has plenty of covering on her bed and that she
wears her overshoes if the ground is damp.
</p>
<p>
My boy would be quite inconsolable, and I
should too, my dear friend, if she is not to be
among our guests. I cannot offer many inducements
except the pleasure which young people
always bring to a house, but I candidly believe
that Percival would give up the idea if she should
not be able to come.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>&#160;</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>Most cordially yours,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'><span class='sc'>Antoinette Juliana St. Clair</span>.”</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>
Miss Campbell smiled as she handed the note
to Billie one morning at the breakfast table. The
two fanciful names of the good-natured, cordial
widow always amused her.
</p>
<p>
“The lonely old home in the country,” so modestly
referred to, was one of the finest places in
the county, and nothing was more coveted by
the young people in West Haven than an invitation
to one of Percival’s house parties, where
everything that the widow and her son could devise
was done for the amusement of the guests.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you must go, dear. I wouldn’t
have you miss it for worlds. The change will
do you good. I have been troubled about you
lately, my child, and if this invitation had not
come, I was going to insist on your seeing the
doctor. I don’t think your liver has been behaving
itself. You have been so out of sorts. But
perhaps a little amusement will be better for
you than a calomel pill.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I am quite well, Cousin Helen,” exclaimed
Billie. “It’s mathematics, I suppose, that
affects my liver.”
</p>
<p>
But Billie was more eager than she would admit to accept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
Mrs. St. Clair’s invitation. The
truth is, the young girl’s conscience had not been
easy lately. She felt that she had done something
which would have grieved and displeased
her father and she could not be perfectly happy
until she had confessed her sins and been forgiven.
</p>
<p>
You perhaps have guessed already that the ten
new five-dollar bills which Mary Price had consigned
to Miss Gray’s care the morning after the
robbery in the school room, was Billie’s money.
</p>
<p>
“You shall take it, Mary,” she insisted.
“Aren’t we exactly the same as sisters? I don’t
want the money, and I know papa would be glad
if he knew.”
</p>
<p>
Billie had finally agreed with Mary that it
would only make matters more complicated to
tell Miss Gray that fifty dollars some one had
placed in Mary’s desk, no doubt to tempt or catch
her, as in the case of the twenty dollars, had
been stolen by a robber almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
Older and wiser people would have told Billie
that this was a very poor piece of advice, and
the deed was no sooner accomplished than the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
girls themselves realized that they had made a
mistake. Miss Gray’s manner to Mary was cold
and formal and the situation was not in the least
relieved. The unhappy girl had hoped that the
principal would speak to her again about the
money, but the subject was never mentioned.
</p>
<p>
“It was all my fault, Mary. I advised you and
forced you to do it. It was not exactly dishonest,
but it wasn’t sincere, and I am beginning to
think Miss Gray is suspicious of me, too.”
</p>
<p>
Another thing had happened which made Billie
uncomfortably and extremely ill at ease in her
mind. Burglars had broken into Mrs. Price’s
home, but they had only succeeded in giving Mary
and her mother a great fright, and had taken
nothing.
</p>
<p>
In her heart Billie knew what the robbers really
wanted. It was the box of jewels locked up in
Mrs. Price’s safe.
</p>
<p>
“I have done wrong,” she kept saying to herself.
“Papa always said that my heart ruled my
head and that I had no judgment. I should
never have burdened Mary and Mrs. Price with
that wretched box. I am almost superstitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
about it, because it brings so much bad luck on
people. After the house party, I shall take it
away.”
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, everything was postponed
until after the house party, and the world for
eight young people seemed to stand still. The
English nation could not look forward with
greater eagerness to the Coronation than our
four Motor Maids and their friends to Percy’s
Hallowe’en house party. It was only a part of
the good fortune which always followed Percy
that Hallowe’en that year fell on Friday, and that
the weather was perfect.
</p>
<p>
They were to have three evenings of fun and
frolic with the Hallowe’en ball on Friday night.
</p>
<p>
In the joy of anticipation and preparation,
Billie and Mary lost sight of their troubles.
Nancy was bubbling over with delight and Elinor
forgot her usual sense of dignity and gave an
indecorous exhibition of happiness by doing a
Dutch twirl all by herself.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we shall all go in ‘The Comet,’”
announced Billie. “It will be lots more fun than
driving behind those poky old carriage horses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
that bring Percy and Mrs. St. Clair in to church
every Sunday.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” echoed the others.
</p>
<p>
There was, indeed, only one flaw in their happiness.
Mrs. St. Clair, who was intimate with
the Rogers family, had insisted on inviting Belle
Rogers.
</p>
<p>
“Who cares?” exclaimed Billie. “She can’t interfere
with our good time and we certainly won’t
interfere with hers.”
</p>
<p>
The St. Clair place was eight miles outside of
West Haven on the main road. A long avenue
bordered with immense pine trees led up to the
commodious, comfortable old house which seemed
to reflect from its shining windows the cheerful
and hospitable character of its mistress.
</p>
<p>
And when the red motor pulled up in front of
“Pine Lodge,” as the place was called, there was
the mistress herself smiling in the doorway, making
the most delightful picture of welcome Billie
had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
“Think of going to a real house party at last,”
exclaimed Billie, with a sigh of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Percival rushed down to help them out; two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
colored men servants carried in their luggage,
and presently they found themselves standing before
a glowing fire in the hall, which was quite
big enough and broad enough to be a room itself.
</p>
<p>
“It is sweet of you to come out and cheer up
two lonely country people, my dears,” Mrs. St.
Clair was saying, as she kissed them all around
twice. “You are really the nicest children. You
must promise to tell me whatever you want, or
if you are not warm enough. You know how
draughty country houses are. Or if you are the
least hungry or your beds are not comfortable or
the water isn’t hot enough for your baths, or
you wish any particular thing to eat——”
</p>
<p>
“Dear me,” laughed Billie, looking around her,
“you make us feel like four visiting princesses,
Mrs. St. Clair. I am sure we could never want
for anything in this cheerful, lovely house.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mrs. St. Clair,” put in Elinor, “we all
know perfectly well that all the chairs at Pine
Lodge are easy and the beds are famous for
being the most comfortable in the county.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair blushed with pleasure. Next to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
saying nice things to people herself, she loved to
have them say nice things to her.
</p>
<p>
“Percival, my darling, where are the others?”
she demanded presently. “Isn’t Belle coming and
what is the name of that little foreign girl she
asked to bring with her?”
</p>
<p>
Percy grinned at his friends good-naturedly,
when Merry seized a cushion from one of the
long settees and began to rock it on his knees,
and Charlie gave a silent imitation of a baby’s
face in the act of crying. But he was used to
these endearing names his mother heaped upon
him, and he only replied:
</p>
<p>
“Give them time, mother; give them time. Remember
they didn’t ride on a comet the same as
this dashing company did. The foreign girl is
Fannie Alta.”
</p>
<p>
“So it was, and it was sweet and thoughtful of
Belle to want to bring her along. She described
the poor little thing as being lonely and strange
in West Haven.”
</p>
<p>
The girls exchanged astonished glances at this
piece of news. Was it possible that Belle Rogers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
and the crafty little Spanish girl whom they instinctively
distrusted were so intimate as this?
</p>
<p>
“Here comes Roly Poly McLane,” cried Percy,
laughing, as he peered through a side light of
the front door. “She’s as jolly and fat as a
clown elephant in the circus.”
</p>
<p>
“Percy, my love,” remonstrated his mother,
which slight show of disapproval was about as
near as she ever got in her life to scolding him.
</p>
<p>
The boys raced down the hall to help Rosomond
McLane out of the high trap in which she
had driven over to Pine Lodge from her home a
few miles away.
</p>
<p>
“Wait, Roly Poly, until Percy gets a derrick.
It’s the only safe way to unload heavy bales,”
cried Merry.
</p>
<p>
“Roly Poly,” said Percy, bowing politely,
“these three noble friends have volunteered with
me to help you get out. I offered to do it alone,
but mother was afraid my young life would be
crushed out of me, if anything should happen,
you know, and——”
</p>
<p>
“Percival, my darling!” cried Mrs. St. Clair.
</p>
<p>
“Help me, indeed,” exclaimed Rosomond, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
a jolly laugh that always started an echo of
other jolly laughs. “Get out of my way all of
you,” and she gave a flying leap from the trap
and bounced as she hit the ground like a rubber
ball.
</p>
<p>
“My dear Rosomond,” cried the widow, running
down the steps to meet her, “don’t take any
notice of these foolish boys. You wouldn’t seem
the same dear, delightful Rosomond if you
weighed a pound less.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t mind them, Mrs. St. Clair. I’m
used to it, you know. Father always calls me
‘Baby Elephant’ and ‘Jumbo,’ and the girls at
school call me ‘Roly Poly,’ and Uncle Jim calls me
‘Fatty.’”
</p>
<p>
Several more boys appeared just then and the
company followed Mrs. St. Clair into what she
called the sitting room, a gay apartment with
chintz curtains at the windows and chintz covered
cushions in the deep wicker chairs. Here
they had tea and chocolate and hot-buttered
toast.
</p>
<p>
“You must eat plenty of food, you know,”
Percy’s mother had admonished them, “because I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
warn you that you will need all your strength to
put up with the fearful ordeals Percy has planned
for to-night——”
</p>
<p>
“Mother,” broke in Percy, “you mustn’t tell.
You will spoil all the fun.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not telling, dear. I’m only warning. But
you know those things that jump at you from behind——”
</p>
<p>
“Stop her quick, somebody,” cried her son, pretending
to gag her mouth with a napkin.
</p>
<p>
It was all very gay and the room buzzed with
talk and laughter when the door opened and a
servant admitted Belle Rogers and Fannie Alta.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair greeted the new visitors as hospitably
as she had the others. She even kissed
Fannie’s dark, foreign little face and called her
“dear” and drew the girl down beside her on the
sofa.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to feel perfectly at home,” she
said. “It was so good of you to have come with
Belle.”
</p>
<p>
She was really the most delightful, beaming,
good-natured creature imaginable, but all her efforts
could not disguise the change which seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
suddenly to have taken place in the behavior of
the others.
</p>
<p>
Somehow the laughter was less free, the talk
less gay and jolly than it had been, and presently
our four particular Motor Maids were glad for
an excuse to go away with Percy and see the
conservatories, while Belle and Fannie drank
their tea with Mrs. St. Clair.
</p>
<p>
After that it was time to dress for dinner. A
neat little maid had unpacked their bags and laid
their best party dresses on the beds. They were
very simple dresses indeed, and Nancy, at least,
thought of floating blue chiffon draperies with a
slight sigh of regret.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know, girls,” said Billie, as she tied
a pink bow around Nancy’s bunch of curls, “I
think we should all take lessons in cheerfulness
from Mrs. St. Clair. She’s so happy because she
always sees the best side of everything. Just
see how nice she is to Belle and Fannie Alta, for
instance.”
</p>
<p>
“With this beautiful house and all her money
and such a nice, good-natured pink-cheeked boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
for a son, I think I could even admire Belle
Rogers and Fannie Alta,” observed Mary.
</p>
<p>
Then Billie remembered that Mary and her
mother were always troubled about money, and
that Mrs. Price was the gentlest, sweetest woman
she had ever known. She wondered if Mrs. St.
Clair could ever be ruffled by disappointment and
bad luck, or if everything were not exactly as it
should be, if she would be the same placid, good-natured
soul.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—THE GHOST PARTY.</h2>
<p>
“I don’t see how you can play any gruesome
Hallowe’en tricks in this house, Mrs. St. Clair,”
said Billie later at the dinner table. “It’s the
abode of cheerfulness. Look at this dining room,
for instance. A skull and crossbones wouldn’t
even look dismal against this white wainscoting
and these pale yellow walls.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s trying to pump you, mother,” put in
Percy. “Now don’t tell her anything.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair smiled archly. How pretty she
looked, Billie thought, in her pink crepe dress,
with a beautiful collar of pearls around her
throat. Nothing would induce the widow to
wear black, and, after a year or two of mourning,
she had gone back to colors and cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
“He has got some big surprises for you, my
dear. I’ll only tell you this much. It will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
quite as ghastly as you could possibly desire, and
I hope nobody is wearing any clothes that will
matter. Your dress, Miss Alta, I am afraid will
spot if you do all the things Percy is planning
for this evening. What a lovely frock, by the
way. I think I have never seen a more beautiful
dress for a young girl.”
</p>
<p>
All eyes were fastened on Fannie’s dress, and
there was general surprise among the girls to
see that Fannie was wearing an exquisite gown
of pale blue satin with an over-dress of blue
gauze, edged with narrow silver fringe. In her
hair was a wreath of pink roses.
</p>
<p>
She was quite unembarrassed under the scrutiny
of all these people, and smiled complacently
at Mrs. St. Clair.
</p>
<p>
Nobody had taken much notice of Belle until
now. They had supposed she had kept so unusually
quiet because she was not in her own
“set,” as she loved to call her coterie of seven.
But to those who were familiar with her, it was
plain that something had happened. She did not
seem herself. Her eyes had a strange gray look
to them. Two little white dents appeared on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
either side of her nose and her lips were shrunk
into pale, narrow lines. But that was not all.
Were they dreaming or was this the first of
Percy’s Hallowe’en jokes? The beautiful, proud
Belle was wearing a faded yellow muslin.
</p>
<p>
She had tried to cover her shoulders with a little
blue scarf, but it was impossible to deceive
the sharp eyes of her schoolmates.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody’s clothes will be hurt, Mother,” put
in Percy, feeling somehow that a cloud had fallen
on the company, although he did not know enough
about girls’ clothes to take in this remarkable
change in Belle’s appearance. “Remember that
this is a ghost party.”
</p>
<p>
“What is a ghost party?” demanded Fannie,
suddenly becoming animated from the admiration
she felt she had attracted.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody wears a sheet and pillow-case,”
answered Percy, “and, for one thing, not a vestige
of dress shows.”
</p>
<p>
A look of triumph came into Belle’s eyes at this
and the two dents began to disappear.
</p>
<p>
“I hear the other people coming, so we had better get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
into our costumes if you are entirely
through.”
</p>
<p>
“Come up to my room, girls. Percy will take
care of the boys. Marie and I are commissioned
to dress you up. I am obeying orders, you see,”
said Mrs. St. Clair.
</p>
<p>
“And remember that you are supposed to be
disguised,” called Percy. “Don’t give yourself
away by giggling, Miss Nancy-Bell.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I shan’t want to giggle if I’m dressed
as a ghost,” answered Nancy, following the
others up the steps.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later a company of spectres invaded
the halls and drawing room of Pine Lodge.
There were silent ghosts and giggling ghosts,
and a roly-poly ghost, who bumped against a thin
ghost and knocked him flat and the thin ghost
cried out:
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shades of departed Jumbo, don’t sit on
me!”
</p>
<p>
Then all the ghosts laughed and one ghost
danced a jig that had the shadow of a resemblance
to the Fishers’ Horn Pipe.
</p>
<p>
Presently there was a long and mournful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
trumpet call from up in the very top of the
house and a portly ghost who seemed to be holding
up a train under her white cotton shroud
said:
</p>
<p>
“Now, my dear spirits, we are all to go up, if
you will be good enough to follow me,” and the
whole troop of ghosts began moving in a spectral
body up the front staircase.
</p>
<p>
There was a second long-drawn-out and despairing
trump, and the phantom beckoned them
to hurry up, with her plump, pretty hand, and remarked:
</p>
<p>
“My darling Percival is so impatient.”
</p>
<p>
Up the next staircase they trooped and finally
up a narrow flight, at the top of which hung a
black curtain with cabalistic signs painted on it
in bright red.
</p>
<p>
Once past the curtain and there was a gasp of
surprise and wonder. The great attic of Pine
Lodge, which stretched over the entire house,
had been transformed into a spirit dance hall.
From the ceiling hung pumpkin jack-o-lanterns
of every size. Plates of salt and alcohol were
burning about the room, giving a ghastly greenish look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
to the picture. An old witch dressed in
black, with a long broomstick, was stationed by a
cauldron of melted lead, placed on a charcoal
stove.
</p>
<p>
Repeating a cabalistic verse with incredible rapidity,
which sounded something like:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Burra, burra pie, cat’s eye, devil fry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer, dinger, singer dinger, blood!”<br />
</p>
<p>
the black witch dropped a spoonful of the lead
into a bowl of water.
</p>
<p>
“Here is your fortune,” she said, in a sing-song
voice to the nearest ghost.
</p>
<p>
“The lead has taken the shape of a letter. It
brings news to you. It comes from over the
water on a ship. The letter is about something
round——”
</p>
<p>
“Money is round,” put in a tall ghost, standing
near. “So are rings and necklaces——”
</p>
<p>
“There is trouble ahead,” went on the witch.
“There is trouble before the letter ever reaches
land.”
</p>
<p>
The ghost who was listening moved away
quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course, it was just a coincidence,” she said
to herself, “but I wonder who the person was who
said that about rings and necklaces. Oh, dear!
Oh, dear! I wish I had never taken that box in
charge.”
</p>
<p>
In another part of the room a red witch was
engaged in launching little fortune sail boats,
made of English walnuts, on a troubled sea in a
tub.
</p>
<p>
There were four other witches about the attic
telling fortunes with cards and in other ways,
two gray ones, a white one, and a green one, and
there was an enormous gray cat with electric
eyes and a tail four feet long that curled up over
its back. At last from behind a curtain came the
strains of weird music, and the witches and the
gray cat danced a quadrille, the witches riding on
their broomsticks in a circle, leaping over the cat
as they advanced down the middle and finally ending
with a romp when all the ghosts joined in and
danced together.
</p>
<p>
After a while the ghosts removed their sheets
and pillow-cases and became human beings once
more, and the side shows, as Percy called them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
began. Every girl at the party bobbed for an
apple, except Belle Rogers, who declined emphatically.
But those who remembered the red
rubber curlers understood her reasons for not
wishing to wet her aureole of golden hair.
</p>
<p>
Fannie Alta plunged her face and neck into the
tub with a reckless laugh, and spotted her pretty
dress without a quiver of regret.
</p>
<p>
Nancy, in a little room hung in black in a remote
corner of the attic, held a lighted candle
over her head, while she looked fearfully in the
glass and combed her hair. For just a breathing
space a boy’s fair, ruddy face passed across the
mirror and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
With a little shriek, Nancy looked quickly over
her shoulder, but she was entirely alone.
</p>
<p>
Billie went rather later than the others to try
her fortune in the mirror room. She had lingered
along with a laughing, teasing circle
around the apple plungers, and, seeing Nancy
come out of the mirror room alone, she strolled
over there. Nancy explained what she was to
do, and left her alone to her fate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did you see any one, Nancy?” laughed Billie
incredulously.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she whispered mysteriously, “I did;
but I wasn’t frightened because——”
</p>
<p>
“Because what?” demanded Billie, pinching her
friend’s round cheek.
</p>
<p>
“Because—it wasn’t a person who would
frighten any one,” answered Nancy, with a laugh,
as she tripped away to the next side show, from
whence issued suppressed screams and howls
which were explained when she pulled the curtain
and a skeleton jumped at her.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Billie had gone into the mirror
room alone. She stood looking gravely at
herself in the glass, while she ran a comb through
her smooth locks with one hand and held a candle
with the other. She seemed to have waited a
good while for the apparition which was supposed
to appear to show its face.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose this booth isn’t in working order
any longer,” she thought, as she laid down the
comb, when suddenly from the deep shadows reflected
in the glass she made out the outline of a
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
Billie smiled. She had been prepared to recognize
one of her friends, but the smile faded from
her lips; she put down the candle quickly and
faced about. The black curtain forming the wall
of the little room was still quivering, but no one
was there.
</p>
<p>
She ran out hurriedly and looked about her.
All the boys and girls were dancing the barn
dance, and the attic had become very cheerful and
gay it seemed to her in the brief moment in which
she had tried her fortune in the mirror room.
</p>
<p>
“It was just a foolish, nervous notion,” she
said to herself, turning to meet Merry Brown,
who was looking for her to be his partner in the
dance. “But that beaked nose and that wicked
eye so close to it,” her thoughts continued.
“Could I have been mistaken?”
</p>
<p>
“Are there any strangers here to-night?” she
asked Merry, as they danced down the room together.
</p>
<p>
“Not a single stranger,” he replied. “Only
the High School crowd.”
</p>
<p>
When the dance was over, they filed in a long,
laughing procession down the three flights of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
steps to supper, and there was nothing spectral or
gruesome about the gay party which gathered
around Mrs. St. Clair’s long table. Billie tried to
talk and sing with the others and laugh at Roly
Poly McLane and Percy, who recited an absurd
dialogue they had prepared beforehand in which
Roly Poly took the part of a fat, old man and
Percy a thin old woman. But all the time she
kept asking herself:
</p>
<p>
“Did I see him, or was it just my imagination?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI.—A STRAY GHOST.</h2>
<p>
When the front door closed after the departing
merry-makers and the sound of the last
wheels died away down the avenue, the guests of
the house party filed slowly up to bed. Mrs. St.
Clair, at the head of the stairs, kissed each of
the girls good-night and shook hands with the
boys. And, as a final token of their regard, before
turning in, the boys trooped from door to
door, singing, “Good-night, ladies,” with Charlie
accompanying on his mouth organ.
</p>
<p>
And now the house was still, and our four
friends in their bathrobes were seated on the
hearth rug around the wood fire in one of the bedrooms,
talking in whispers, as girls will do after
a party.
</p>
<p>
“Do you suppose Belle Rogers has been converted,
or reformed, or something?” observed
Nancy. “What else could have induced her to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
so unselfish as to wear Fannie’s old dress and let
Fannie wear her best one?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the mystery of the age,” said Elinor.
“And how different she seemed, too. How quiet
and meek. Perhaps, after all, it was her clothes
that made her haughty. Who could be anything
but lowly in a faded yellow muslin?”
</p>
<p>
“She was angry at first,” put in Mary. “I
saw the danger signals at dinner. But I really
believe she had as good a time as any of us afterwards.
Perhaps she realized that without the
blue satin, she was just on a par with the rest of
us, and she forgot to be conscious.”
</p>
<p>
“And how different Fannie was under the influence
of the blue satin,” continued Elinor.
“She talked and laughed quite loudly, and she
was really rude to Belle several times. Girls, if
we ever have blue satins, will they change our
dispositions——”
</p>
<p>
A tap at the door interrupted the conversation,
and Mrs. St. Clair, in a long lavender dressing
gown, tripped into the room.
</p>
<p>
“I hope our talking hasn’t disturbed you, Mrs.
St. Clair,” said Billie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, no, dear, I am glad you were talking, because
I had hoped to find some one of you still
awake. I have come to ask a great favor. Will
one of you, or all of you, go with me up in the
attic for a few minutes? I should have asked
one of the servants, but their lights are all out.
I suppose they are sound asleep. Percy is asleep,
too. I have just come from his room. He is
tired out. You can’t think how hard he has
worked in the last few days.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me go with you, Mrs. St. Clair,” put in
Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“Let us all go,” suggested Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Very well, dear. The more of you the better.
To tell the truth, I am a little worried. It’s
nothing, of course; I am sure to find it, but I
should like to take a look before I go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you lost something, Mrs. St. Clair?”
asked Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have lost my pearl necklace. I really
never missed it until a few moments ago. I have
looked downstairs everywhere, but I feel sure
that I dropped it in the attic when I was dancing
that ridiculous twirling waltz with Ben. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
serves me right for trying to be a young girl
when I am really such an old lady.”
</p>
<p>
“You are really the youngest of us all,” protested
the four young girls, following her on
tiptoe up the stairs into the attic.
</p>
<p>
All the members of the searching party were
sure that the necklace would be found at once
somewhere on the attic floor, or in the folds of
the sheet or the pillow-case Mrs. St. Clair had
been wearing. Yet Billie and Mary had good
reason to know that robbers were at large in the
village of West Haven, and the memory of the
face Billie had seen in the mirror suddenly became
painfully distinct.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair lit a few gas jets in the attic
and the great place seemed ghastly enough in
the half light with the grotesque jack-o-lanterns
grinning at them from above; the black-curtained
side shows and an occasional sheet and pillow-case
made a weird picture.
</p>
<p>
They searched the floor carefully, looked into
the booths with candles, shook out sheets and
pillow-cases, but there was no sign of the missing
necklace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“If it had only been something else,” said Mrs.
St. Clair. “I should rather have lost almost anything
in the world than my pearl necklace. It
was a wedding present from Percival’s father
and I valued it more than all my other jewelry
together. I don’t see how I could have dropped
it so carelessly. When we went down to supper
I threw a scarf around my shoulders and that
is probably why I never noticed that my pearls
were gone. You were standing near me, Mary,
and Belle and her friend were there, too. You
don’t remember to have noticed the necklace at
that time, do you? One of you helped me on with
my scarf.”
</p>
<p>
Mary shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“I must ask Belle and Miss Alta to-morrow. It
is so important to know whether I lost the necklace
up here or below.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you dropped it on the steps,” suggested
one of the girls.
</p>
<p>
“If I did, it must have been trod on by many
pairs of feet, then. Oh, dear, I am so sorry.
Only this evening I said to myself, I must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
the clasp to the necklace repaired. I had intended
to take it to town next week to the jeweller’s.
</p>
<p>
“But I must not keep you up any longer. You
were dear children to come up with me. Now
go to bed and don’t think of it any more. I
should not have been so selfish. You are all dead
tired, I know, for I am myself.”
</p>
<p>
They turned and trooped downstairs again,
and with softly spoken good-nights separated at
their bedroom doors.
</p>
<p>
Billie and Mary were the last to enter the room
they shared. They had stopped for a drink of
ice water from a big glass pitcher, which had
been placed with a tray of tumblers on a table
at the far end of the hall. They were drinking
their water silently, each absorbed in her own
thoughts, when suddenly Mary grasped Billie’s
hand and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“Look! On the steps!”
</p>
<p>
But Billie was looking with all her eyes before
Mary had spoken.
</p>
<p>
A figure was gliding down the steps wrapped
in a sheet. The stray ghost had evidently seen
the girls at the same moment they had caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
sight of it, for it finished the flight almost with
a bound, and with a swift run disappeared
through a door leading to a passage back of the
steps, with Billie and Mary running behind. But
the sheeted figure was too swift for them, and
they heard one of the doors in the passage open
and close softly just as they reached the entrance.
</p>
<p>
“It was this door,” said Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Or this one,” said Billie, pointing to the door
of the room next the one Mary had chosen as the
door the phantom had disappeared through.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll settle it,” said Billie. “I’ll knock on this
one and you knock on that one.”
</p>
<p>
“They are the small single rooms that Belle and
Fannie and Roly Poly have,” whispered Mary,
as she tapped on a door.
</p>
<p>
There was no answer and she went in. It was
Belle’s room and she was sleeping deeply. Mary
smiled as she noticed that Belle now wore a night
cap over the rubber curlers. Her cheek was pillowed
on her hand and her breath came softly and
regularly.
</p>
<p>
No answer came to Billie’s tap, either, and
when she turned the knob she found that the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
was locked. She tapped again and rattled the
knob.
</p>
<p>
“Who is there?” came a sleepy voice.
</p>
<p>
“Open the door,” called Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me who you are first.”
</p>
<p>
“Billie Campbell.”
</p>
<p>
Presently the door was thrown open and Fannie,
with her dark hair standing out all over her
head in a dishevelled mass, peered into the hall.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter?” she asked. “The house
is not on fire?”
</p>
<p>
“No, but Mary and I were in the hall and we
saw some one come down from the attic and go
into one of these rooms, and we thought we had
better wake you up.”
</p>
<p>
“They could not have come in here,” said Fannie.
“My door was locked.”
</p>
<p>
Billie looked at her curiously.
</p>
<p>
“What a little actress you are,” she thought.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t matter, only Mrs. St. Clair had
lost something, and we were afraid a thief might
be in the house. You know there have been several
robberies lately in West Haven.”
</p>
<p>
Fannie gave her a long and scornful stare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
“At the High School, you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Particularly at the High School,” replied
Billie gently. Somehow, she felt a sort of contemptuous
pity for this unfortunate little creature
who had been taught, perhaps by poverty,
to stoop to so much villainy.
</p>
<p>
“What’s all this racket about?” demanded
Rosomond McLane, opening her door which was
the third one along the passage and thrusting out
her merry, round face.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t hear anything did you?” asked
Billie. “Mary and I thought we saw some one in
a ghost dress come down this passage and go into
one of these doors.”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens! I am terrified out of my wits,
I would rather it would be a burglar than a ghost.
Did you really see something?”
</p>
<p>
“Forget it,” said Billie. “Go back to bed and
lock your door. It was just a shadow, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
Fannie had already locked her own door and
the girls retreated to their room, somewhat crestfallen,
feeling very much like two fighters who
had been worsted in battle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
When they had crawled into bed and settled
themselves under the covers, Billie gave a deep
sigh and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“Mary, dear, which one do you think it was?”
</p>
<p>
“There is only one thing that would make me
think it was Belle,” replied Mary. “If she had
really been asleep, she would have waked and
come out to find what was the matter. She is
the most deadly curious soul alive.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s very slight evidence, Mary. She
might have been specially tired to-night. Now,
I believe it was Fannie. She had such a wild,
dishevelled look and her door was locked. She
is such a creeping, crawling little thing. Besides,
I don’t believe Belle would have had the courage
to go up in the attic alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Billie,” observed Mary, after a short silence,
“I don’t know what it is all about, but something
is going on around us. I believe that you
and I, in some way, are mixed up in some kind of
conspiracy. The box of jewels is in it and Fannie
and Belle are in it. It’s like seeing a lot of
figures moving about through a thick curtain.
You know they are there, but you don’t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
what they are all doing. I’m frightened, Billie,
very frightened.”
</p>
<p>
Mary gave that dry sob which was just as
painful as crying and much worse to hear.
</p>
<p>
Billie put her arms around her friend and tried
to comfort her.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be scared, Mary, dear. It will all come
right. I have made up my mind to one thing.
That is, I will not leave that unlucky box at your
mother’s house any longer. We shall have to
find some new place to keep it.”
</p>
<p>
Presently the two girls dropped off to slumber,
and of all the sleepers in the big house, only one
person heard the clock in the hall strike the passing
hours. She tossed and tumbled on her bed
like a boat on a restless sea, and moaned to herself.
Her lace-frilled night cap had slipped, and
one red rubber horn pointed upward, like an accusing
finger.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—MRS. RUGGLES.</h2>
<p>
Breakfast was late next morning, and there
were some heavy eyes at the pretty table. Belle
was pale and nervous, and Mary, too, wore an
anxious look on her face. Even the plump and
jovial Mrs. St. Clair was not quite herself. Her
eyes had a puzzled, absent-minded expression, as
if she were trying to remember something that
had almost faded out of her memory. But she
forced herself to smile and talk with her young
guests, and only the Motor Maids really noticed
her abstraction.
</p>
<p>
“What do you intend to do to-day, Percival,
dearest?” she asked her son.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you remember, mother, that Billie is to
take some of us and the side-seated wagon the
others over to Mrs. Ruggles? I wrote her to expect
us by two this afternoon, and we’ll be hungry
enough by then to eat everything in sight.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who is Mrs. Ruggles?” asked Billie, who was
not yet familiar with various picturesque and interesting
characters living around West Haven.
</p>
<p>
“Wait until you see her,” replied Mrs. St. Clair.
“She is a queer old woman, but she has a great
many friends and you can’t help liking her,
and her food—dear me, you never imagined such
meals as she can get up.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t go and give things away, mother,”
remonstrated Percy. “The others have all met
Mrs. Ruggles, but Billie hasn’t and neither has
Miss Alta, and we might as well give them a little
surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems to me that West Haven is full of
surprises,” observed Billie. “Papa and I used to
wander about the world together like two vagabonds,
but in all that time we never had so many
adventures and excitements as I have had here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, there won’t be any excitement about
this trip,” said Percy. “It’s just a ride across the
country to the shore, one grand, large meal, and
then home again in time for another feed, and
you’ll all be ready for bed.”
</p>
<p>
It was arranged for those who were to drive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
to start well ahead of the others in the “handicap
race,” as Percy called it, in order to get to
Mrs. Ruggles’ at the same time. The Motor
Maids went in “The Comet” with their particular
friends, which was tacitly agreed upon, and
Roly Poly McLane drove with Belle and Fannie
and three boys in the St. Clair trim-looking depot
wagon. They were not even to take the same
road as the motor car, but were to go by a short
cut over a road too sandy for automobiles.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair, who was not to be in the party,
inspected each girl with motherly interest before
the start. She appeared to have an endless store
of wraps, ulsters, sweaters and fur coats, veils
and scarfs, which she bundled on her guests
without the slightest regard for sex or size.
</p>
<p>
“Young people never know how to keep warm,”
she said. “Especially girls. They always think
warm clothing is unbecoming, when really nothing
is more unbecoming than purple noses and
blue lips. Percival, my darling, don’t you think
you’ll need your ear muffs?”
</p>
<p>
“No, mother,” answered her son firmly, “not
on the first of November.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I implore you, my son; I entreat you,”
cried the importunate woman, and Percy, with
admirable patience permitted her to slip them on
his ears, though he promptly removed them when
the motor car had turned into the road and he
could no longer see his mother waving her
handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
“I must look remarkably like Dr. Cook,” he
said, laughing, as he removed some of the layers
of wraps and scarfs his mother had loaded
him with.
</p>
<p>
“The Comet” was in splendid trim that morning.
</p>
<p>
“He gets cranky and unmanageable exactly
like a human being,” Billie had often said about
him, but to-day he appeared almost to take human
enjoyment in the long stretch of hard-beaten
road and the crisp autumn air.
</p>
<p>
“Does this mysterious Mrs. Ruggles live in a
palace or a hut?” asked Billie, after a while, her
curiosity increasing as the salty breeze straight
from the ocean reminded her that they were approaching
the coast.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little of both,” replied Percy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“She’s a queen, herself, Mrs. Ruggles is,” put
in Ben.
</p>
<p>
“I believe she thinks she is one, really,” said
Elinor. “If she doesn’t like a person, she almost
says, ‘Off with his head.’”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought you said she was a cook?”
</p>
<p>
“She is,” answered Merry. “She’s a queenly
cook and a cookly queen.”
</p>
<p>
“You are all a lot of crack-brained, foolish
people,” exclaimed Billie, exasperated. “I feel
as if ‘The Comet’ couldn’t take me fast enough
to satisfy my curiosity about Mrs. Ruggles.”
</p>
<p>
She put on the third speed and the red motor
took to the course like a young race horse as he
rounds the curve toward home. It was a long
and rather chilly ride before they reached the
abode of Mrs. Ruggles. The young people found
themselves buttoning their wraps around them
quite gratefully and snuggling down in the car.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are,” said Percy, at last.
</p>
<p>
Billie stopped the car and examined with much
curiosity a quaint old house, rather tumbled down
at second glance, but with an air of comfort about
it that no amount of disrepair could overcome.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
Smoke was pouring out of the middle chimney
and the reflection on the small window panes indicated
that there was a roaring fire in the front
room.
</p>
<p>
What the place looked like on the inside was
nothing more nor less than an old Spanish inn.
Billie did not know this because she had never
seen one, but the room reminded her vaguely of
something very romantic and picturesque, and
what was most curious about the place was that
the outside seemed to have no connection whatever
with the inside. They were not even related
to each other by distant kinship. Outside
were the dignified gray walls and gabled windows
of an old seashore house. The inside appeared
to be one very large room. The uneven
floor was paved with red tile and in a big stone
fireplace at one end burned an enormous fire of
driftwood. From the blackened rafters hung
garlands of red peppers, bunches of herbs and
strings of onions and garlic. Shining copper vessels
were ranged on shelves and around two sides
of the room ran a gallery with steps leading up
from one end.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“Am I in a dream,” cried Billie. “I feel as if
I had been transported somewhere suddenly.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it fascinating?” said Elinor. “The old
house has been in Mrs. Ruggles’ family for two
hundred years. It used to be a sort of sailors’
inn, and there are many stories connected with
it. But here she comes herself. She’s just as
wonderful as her house.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ruggles was certainly a remarkable figure.
She was very tall, one of the tallest women
Billie had ever seen, with coal black hair, shiny
dark eyes, rather too close together, a beaked
eagle nose, and a very determined mouth, with a
slightly humorous curve to the lips, which softened
her somewhat stern face.
</p>
<p>
She wore a most outlandish dress for that part
of the world, of striped red and black cotton, but
she was scrupulously clean, and the coarse cotton
kerchief tied around her neck was as white as
snow. Her stockings also were white, and she
wore men’s low shoes of enormous size, even for
a woman of her height.
</p>
<p>
The boys and girls all shook hands with her
as if she were an old friend. She called them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
by their first names and when she was introduced
to Billie she gave her a long, keen look that
seemed to read the young girl’s most hidden and
secret thoughts. She walked with an erect carriage
and majestic tread, and Billie had a feeling
that she had been introduced to a personage.
</p>
<p>
“She’s a great old girl,” said Merry Brown,
when Mrs. Ruggles had disappeared into the
back regions of the house to finish cooking the
dinner. “She can sail a boat as well as anybody
along this coast. She fishes, digs for clams,
catches lobsters in traps, and does all the things
the fishermen around here do and more, too, because
she is the jim dandiest cook in the county.”
</p>
<p>
“Hasn’t she any husband or family?” asked
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“She was married twice. Ruggles, the second
husband, was an Irishman. He was a fine fellow,
a sea captain, but he died long ago. Her children
are floating about the country somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“What was her name before she married?
Nothing like Ruggles, I am sure.”
</p>
<p>
“No, it was Sabater. Mrs. Ruggles’ father
was captain of a schooner which carried freight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
up and down the coast. They say her grandfather
was a great old fighter and came near
being hanged as a spy by both sides in the Revolution.”
</p>
<p>
It was all very interesting, and Billie was still
asking questions of the others when the carriage
arrived with the rest of the party.
</p>
<p>
“Why, where is Fannie?” they demanded,
noticing her absence from the depot wagon.
</p>
<p>
“She complained of a headache and went
home,” answered Belle. “We met one of your
vehicles on the road, Percy, coming from town,
and she got in and drove back.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad,” answered Percy. “But she’s very
sensible if she doesn’t feel well. It’s a long drive
and fairly chilly when it gets late.”
</p>
<p>
Fannie was not much missed, however, from
the jolly party which now gathered around the
crackling wood fire. Presently the inn-keeper,
fish-woman, queen, whatever she was, led the
girls up the narrow flight of stairs at one end of
the room to the balcony, on which opened a row
of little bedrooms, like ship cabins. She was a
very silent, busy woman, and she did not linger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
while they smoothed their rumpled locks and
washed the dust from their faces.
</p>
<p>
Billie, who also was not one to linger at the
dressing table, went out on the gallery and stood
looking down into the picturesque room. The
place fascinated her and she strolled along, peeping
into the other small rooms, where, no doubt,
Mrs. Ruggles’ father and grandfather had put
up many a seafaring guest in years gone by.
</p>
<p>
At the other end of the gallery were more
rooms, and she could not resist the temptation to
glance into them while she waited for the other
girls. Two of the doors were open, one into a
large empty room and one into a scantily furnished
bedroom. The next door was half closed.
Should she look in? Billie hesitated. It was very
impolite of her, but she knew that old Mrs. Ruggles
lived alone, and there could be no one to
intrude on. She pushed the door gently and
looked in, then retreated quickly. The room was
not empty, after all. In the immense, old-fashioned
bed so high that it was necessary to stand
on a foot stool at one side in order to plunge into
it, lay a woman. Billie thought she was asleep at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
first. Her eyes were closed and her long black
hair was spread back of her on the pillow like a
dusky mantel. The young girl stood transfixed
on the threshold. Then the woman opened her
eyes and looked straight into Billie’s.
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon,” said Billie politely, and
backed away, her heart beating so fast that she
almost choked for breath.
</p>
<p>
The others were just going downstairs, chatting
and laughing together, even Belle Rogers,
who seemed, somehow, softened and quite different.
There was no chance to tell about the
strange woman just then, and Billie kept her
knowledge to herself. But the large dark eyes
haunted her memory and she could not forget
the face, of which she had caught only a fleeting
glance.
</p>
<p>
Then came the dinner. Mrs. Ruggles did not
wait on the guests. The dishes were placed on
the table and they helped themselves, while Merry
and Percy, with napkins over their arms, like
well-trained butlers, removed one set of plates
and brought on another.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps these young people, who were not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
epicures by any means, did not realize how delicious
Mrs. Ruggles’ dinner really was. But an
older and more experienced person would have
appreciated some of those delightful concoctions
of rice and pimentos, soup thick and rich, fowls
done to a turn, and a dish of corn meal and
chopped meat and tomatoes, like a Mexican tamale.
But they enjoyed it and the pudding that
followed and the cups of strong black coffee.
</p>
<p>
It was a merry meal, too, with jokes and songs
and much laughter. Mrs. Ruggles moved ponderously
about the room or sat silently by the
fire. Occasionally her face lit up with a delightful
smile, and she would turn and beam approvingly
at Percy or Merry or Roly Poly McLane,
who were the chief fun-makers.
</p>
<p>
After dinner Billie seized an opportunity to
speak to the strange woman.
</p>
<p>
“We had a splendid dinner, Mrs. Ruggles,” she
said. “I should think you would have lots of
people stopping here in this delightful place.”
</p>
<p>
“The Inn is closed now,” she answered. “I
don’t rent my rooms any more.”
</p>
<p>
“And you have no guests at all?” asked Billie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ruggles looked at her for so long that
Billie felt desperately uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she answered shortly, and began clearing
off the table with a scowl that reminded Billie
of some one somewhere.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—FANNIE ALTA.</h2>
<p>
In the meantime, Mrs. St. Clair, left to the
quiet seclusion of her own home, became forthwith
a very determined and resolute character.
</p>
<p>
First she summoned to her aid the old colored
butler, who had been with her many years, and
together they searched every part of the house
where she had been the night before. They went
over the attic thoroughly and satisfied themselves
that the lost pearl necklace could not have been
dropped there. They hunted through the downstairs
rooms, shook out the sofa cushions, looked
under the rugs and behind curtains. There was
not a crack nor cranny of the rooms she had
lately frequented that Mrs. St. Clair and old
Randolph did not scour.
</p>
<p>
Like many another easy-going, amiable soul,
Mrs. St. Clair, when roused to action, was capable
of the most surprising, almost fierce determination,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
and when Fannie Alta returned,
pleading the excuse of a headache, she hardly
recognized in the white intense face, the rosy,
dimpled countenance of the widow.
</p>
<p>
Fannie retired to her room, but when Mrs. St.
Clair went to the telephone in the upper hall,
she crept to the door, opened it a crack, and overheard
snatches of this conversation:
</p>
<p>
“Do you happen to have a good detective?
That’s fortunate. The famous Mr. Bangs home
on his vacation? Has a motor cycle? Very well,
he ought to get here in an hour. Tell him to
hurry. Thank you. Good-by.”
</p>
<p>
A tray of luncheon was brought to Fannie, but
she ate very little. She sat in her room thinking
hard. Then, with a sudden resolution, she
jumped up and began to move about. First she
packed her valise. Then, tying her handkerchief
about her head, she put on a very woe-begone expression
and left the room. Mrs. St. Clair was
in the living room, a maid told her, and Fannie
found her pacing nervously up and down the
bright, chintz-hung place.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid you are not feeling so well, Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
Alta,” the widow said politely, but with just a
shade of coldness in her tone.
</p>
<p>
“I am much worse,” answered Fannie. “I feel
quite ill. I wish to return to my mamma. May
I be driven home?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair hesitated and a very strange
expression came into her face.
</p>
<p>
“You may go in a few hours, Miss Alta.
There is no one to take you just now. Randolph
is needed here and the other men are off working
on the place. Perhaps you had better lie down
in your room until I can arrange to send you
back. Did you try the aromatic spirits of ammonia?”
</p>
<p>
“If no one can take me,” said the Spanish girl
irritably, not taking any notice of the question,
“I shall walk.”
</p>
<p>
“But I thought you were ill?”
</p>
<p>
“I am, but the walk will help my head.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I cannot permit it,” said Mrs. St. Clair
firmly. “Go to your room and in another hour
you will be sent home.”
</p>
<p>
Fannie started to reply, but she checked herself
and left the room. Mrs. St. Clair, stripped of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
her smiles and good-natured pleasantries, was
not a person to be disobeyed, and Fannie was
quick to recognize that fact.
</p>
<p>
She had hardly reached the second floor, when
she heard the whirring sound of a motor cycle,
followed almost immediately by a quick ring of
the bell. Fannie leaned far over the banisters,
and when she turned to go to her room, after a
small, dapper-looking man had been admitted, she
was somewhat embarrassed to find Mrs. St.
Clair’s maid looking at her with an expression of
extreme amazement.
</p>
<p>
Fannie hurried to her room and for the next
fifteen minutes stood irresolutely first on one foot,
then on the other. Finally, with an air of determination,
she opened her satchel.
</p>
<p>
In the sitting room downstairs Mrs. St. Clair
and Mr. Bangs were in close conference.
</p>
<p>
“I do not really know the girl, Mr. Bangs. She
is a Cuban or a South American, or something.
Her name is Alta and she was brought here by
my son’s guest. It is impossible for me to accuse
a visitor in my own house of stealing the
most valued and handsomest possession I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
in the world. She is a queer little creature and
looks sly and unreliable to me. But, of course,
that is not really evidence. What I have been
racking my brain all night and morning to recall
is whether it was not she who, when she
helped me off with my ghost dress last night,
fumbled at my neck a moment.
</p>
<p>
“It amounts to this, Mr. Bangs,” the widow
continued after a pause, “I can’t get over the
impression that she has stolen my necklace. The
other children here I have known all their lives.
My servants have been with me for years, and
she is the one suspicious person in the house.
Now, what I want you to do is to help me to
find out the whole thing without arousing her
suspicions. If she is the thief, she may return
the necklace, and be sent back to town before the
others arrive, and it will be easy enough to make
excuses. You are a very able man, Mr. Bangs,
and I know that you are only home for a rest,
but I do so need your help. Now, what do you
advise?”
</p>
<p>
“Have you looked among her things yet?”
asked the detective.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, because the conviction only came to me
after she returned. I did have suspicions, I will
admit, but I put them aside. When she came
back I saw that she was uneasy and anxious, and
only a few moments ago she asked to be sent
home.”
</p>
<p>
“H-m,” mused the detective. “Suppose,” he
continued, “that you call her down and let me
talk to her as if I needed her assistance, she being
the only member of the party available.”
</p>
<p>
The advice was acted upon, and presently Fannie,
still with the handkerchief swathing her forehead,
looking very nervous and pale, entered the
room.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Alta,” began the widow kindly, “I am
sorry to have disturbed you when you were ill,
but we are in great trouble and we thought perhaps
you might help us. Did you know that last
night I lost my beautiful pearl necklace, the most
precious thing I have in the world?”
</p>
<p>
Fannie showed great surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Did it not come unclasped and slip?” she suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have reason to believe that it did not slip
from my neck, because we have searched the
place thoroughly. It must have been taken. I
talked it all over with the other girls last night
and they helped me look for it, but now I need
some one else, and in their absence I have sent
for you. Mr. Bangs, who is a detective, has come
down to lend me his aid, and we thought we
might take you into the conspiracy with us.”
</p>
<p>
The widow paused for breath.
</p>
<p>
Fannie sat down and folded her hands nervously.
</p>
<p>
“I do not see how I can help,” she said, after
a pause.
</p>
<p>
“Possibly you cannot,” put in Mr. Bangs, “but
Mrs. St. Clair thought you might have noticed
something unusual, and being a guest were too
polite to speak of it. For instance, were you
standing near Mrs. St. Clair when she removed
the sheet and pillow case?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Fannie, “there were several of us
in the party.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you notice who unpinned the sheet for
Mrs. St. Clair?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
Fannie paused a long time without replying.
</p>
<p>
“It was not you who did it?”
</p>
<p>
The young girl compressed her lips and looked
the detective squarely in the eye.
</p>
<p>
“The girl who unpinned the sheet was Mary
Price,” she replied, “and since you are determined
to question me, I will tell you.”
</p>
<p>
She drew a deep breath, looked first at the
detective, then at Mrs. St. Clair, and proceeded:
</p>
<p>
“I did notice that she removed the sheet from
your shoulders and her actions were very strange.
But, knowing what I did, I was not surprised, and
I am not surprised to hear now that you have lost
something valuable, Mrs. St. Clair,” she went on,
more and more glibly, as she saw she was gaining
the interest of the other two.
</p>
<p>
“What were Miss Price’s actions?” asked the
detective, taking Fannie’s statements in the order
she had made them.
</p>
<p>
Fannie frowned.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do not know. She was strange. She
behaved strangely and she went away at once.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean she left the room?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
“I cannot say. I saw her no more until supper.”
</p>
<p>
“Where were you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I was about, dancing, playing, laughing
with the others,” replied Fannie carelessly.
</p>
<p>
“You said a moment ago you knew something
about Miss Price. Will you tell us what it is?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, but I hesitate. It is unkind to spread so
terrible a story.”
</p>
<p>
“We will treat it confidentially,” said the detective
drily.
</p>
<p>
“A great many people know it already,” went
on Fannie. “The whole school knows it, in fact.
Miss Gray, the principal, and some of the teachers,
who have lost money and articles. I, myself,
have good reason to know it.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it that you know?” asked the detective.
</p>
<p>
“That Mary Price is a thief. She has been
stealing all the autumn from the other girls and
the teachers at the High School.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, impossible! I will not believe it,” cried
Mrs. St. Clair. “Dear, sweet, quiet Mary.
There must be some mistake, Miss Alta. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
should be more careful how you spread such dangerous
gossip. Mary Price and her mother
have many devoted friends in West Haven.”
</p>
<p>
“You may ask Miss Gray, then. She will tell
you,” said Fannie stiffly.
</p>
<p>
“Just to verify your statement, Miss Alta, I
will telephone Miss Gray this instant,” exclaimed
the widow angrily, leaving the room and hastening
upstairs to the telephone.
</p>
<p>
While she was gone, and she was away some
time, the detective began to question Fannie. He
was a very experienced man in his profession and
he pressed her so skillfully that several times she
tripped in her answers and finally grew excited.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you it is true,” she cried. “She not only
is a thief, but she has a confederate. Billie Campbell
is her assistant. Perhaps you think I took the
necklace,” she burst out at last. “You have the
right to search among my things. I had no way
to know that suspicion rested on me. If I took
the necklace, it will still be among my things.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t get excited, Miss Alta, nobody has accused
you of anything. We simply needed your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
valuable evidence. Why do you say Miss Campbell
is a confederate to the thieving?”
</p>
<p>
Fannie had gone farther than she intended,
however, and she refused to give any more information.
But the detective saw that when she
was angry and frightened, she would talk, and
after a pause, he said:
</p>
<p>
“You perhaps know that you are the only person
in the household on whom suspicion might
rest.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why I should be suspected,” she
exclaimed hotly, “when Mary Price is already
known to be a thief——”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you have a grudge against Miss
Price?”
</p>
<p>
“I have not,” she cried, stamping her foot.
</p>
<p>
“Did no one ever suspect you of taking the
things at the High School? You know that often
happens—one girl is blamed for another’s——”
</p>
<p>
Fannie flew into a passion.
</p>
<p>
“I tell you Billie Campbell and Mary Price are
thieves. They have a whole box of valuable
things they have stolen, stored away in Mrs.
Price’s safe.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
“What sort of things?”
</p>
<p>
“Jewelry,” burst out Fannie, then stopped and
bit her lip. “But I may be mistaken about that,”
she added, trying to speak calmly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair hurried into the room with the
necklace in her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Where did you find it?” asked Mr. Bangs.
</p>
<p>
“I found it,” she began, then paused. “It was
found,” she added. “You may go, Miss Alta.
Thank you very much. And if you care to go
back to town, Randolph will drive you in at
once.”
</p>
<p>
When Fannie had left the room, the widow
beat her hands together, and the tears rolled down
her cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“I found it in Mary Price’s bag,” she said.
“And Miss Gray tells me that it is true. Mary
has been suspected of stealing all autumn.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—MARY BEFORE HER JUDGES.</h2>
<p>
It was late when the young people returned
from Mrs. Ruggles’. They were in gay spirits
and Mrs. St. Clair could hear them talking and
laughing in the hall, first the motorists and then
the ones who had driven. She did not go down to
meet them and they scattered to their rooms to
wash their faces and smooth their wind-blown
locks. There was no time to dress for supper.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see how I can face them,” she said to
herself. “I’m so unhappy, and I’m afraid they
will notice that I have been crying.”
</p>
<p>
But she bathed her temples in cold water, put
on a cheery-colored silk dress, and went downstairs
when the gong sounded for supper. Down
trooped the boys and girls with sparkling eyes
and glowing cheeks. The sound of their happy
laughter reached her below and she pressed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
hand to her heart and sighed deeply. Then her
expression hardened:
</p>
<p>
“Little wretch,” she exclaimed. “She should
be well punished, and she shall be, too.”
</p>
<p>
“‘Soup of the evening, beautiful soup,’” sang
Merry, dancing a jig in the hall:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Beautiful soup so rich and green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting in a hot tureen!’”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Who for such dainties would not stoop?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soup of the evening, beautiful soup,’”<br />
</p>
<p>
continued Rosomond, seizing Merry’s hands and
whirling with him up and down the hall until they
both fell in a laughing heap on the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we have had such a good time,” cried
Billie and Mary together, taking each a hand of
Mrs. St. Clair.
</p>
<p>
“It has been such glorious fun,” went on Billie,
“and we are just as hungry for supper as if we
hadn’t eaten enough food to feed a regiment this
afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“And such fine food, too, Mrs. St. Clair,” said
Mary. “I think it was the most delightful party
I have ever been to.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am glad you were so happy,” replied Mrs.
St. Clair, making an effort to smile and succeeding
very poorly.
</p>
<p>
Mary, who was as sensitive to changes in manner
as an aeolian harp is to the slightest breeze,
looked at her hostess quickly and noticed the red
rims on her eyelids.
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you feeling well, dear Mrs. St. Clair?”
she asked gently.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. St. Clair put her hands on the girl’s
shoulders and looked into the clear dark eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I am quite well, Mary. A little upset over
something that happened to-day. That is all.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the pearl necklace?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“I am so sorry. I wish we could have found
it for you.”
</p>
<p>
“It has been found, Mary,” said the widow,
turning her head away so as not to see Mary’s
face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you did find it? I am so glad. Where
was it?”
</p>
<p>
“Supper is served, Mrs. St. Clair,” said Randolph,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
opening the door to the dining room,
where the others were already waiting.
</p>
<p>
“We will talk about where it was found later,”
she said to Mary, who gave her a puzzled look,
as she followed into the room.
</p>
<p>
When supper was over, the boys and girls
scattered about the various rooms. Roly Poly
and Nancy got up charades. Billie curled up in
a big easy chair by the fire. She had got most
of the wind in her face and she was very sleepy.
No one noticed, therefore, when Mrs. St. Clair,
drawing Mary’s hand through her arm, led her
out of the room.
</p>
<p>
“I want to see you upstairs, Mary,” she said.
“Will you come to my little private sitting room?
There is something I wish to talk with you
about.”
</p>
<p>
Mary was still wondering what in the world
could be wanted of her, when Mrs. St. Clair drew
her into a pretty little pink boudoir at the end of
the hall. The door to the next room had been
left open, but Mary did not notice a small, dapper
man sitting there in a high-backed cretonne
chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p>
The pearl necklace was lying on a table in the
boudoir. Mrs. St. Clair picked it up and held it
out to Mary.
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever see it closely before, Mary?”
she asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, I never did,” answered the girl, with enthusiasm.
“How beautiful it is. No wonder you
were so unhappy. But where did you find it?”
</p>
<p>
“That is just why I brought you in here,
Mary. I wanted to ask you if you could guess
where the necklace had been found at last.”
</p>
<p>
Mary suddenly became very grave. She was
beginning to notice now that Mrs. St. Clair was
in an unusually serious frame of mind and that
something must have happened concerning the
necklace which the others had not heard.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand,” she said, after a pause.
“Why should I guess?”
</p>
<p>
“Is it possible, Mary,” exclaimed the widow,
“that even after you were told I had found the
necklace you were not just a little frightened, a
little uneasy? Didn’t you suspect when I asked
you to come up here with me that I was going to
speak to you about the necklace?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p>
Mary looked at her in wonder for a few minutes.
Then a light dawned on her.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Fannie Alta again,” she said, in a low
voice. “She must have put the necklace among
some of my things.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you do know where I found the necklace?”
cried the widow triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
“I can guess,” said Mary. “You found it in
my suit case. It’s the second time she’s done
something like that.”
</p>
<p>
“Mary, Mary—don’t blame it on any one else.
I did find the necklace in your valise——”
</p>
<p>
Mary stood up. Her eyes were blazing and
her small slender frame was shaken with emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Do you mean to insinuate that I stole your
pearl necklace?” she cried.
</p>
<p>
Her words rang out in a high, clear tone that
made the small man in the next room stir uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“How else did the necklace get into your bag,
Mary?”
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>
“Fannie Alta put it there. She put twenty dollars
into my pocket not long ago and tried to
accuse me of taking that, and when I gave it back
to her she hadn’t a word to say.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Mary, Fannie is not your only accuser.
Miss Gray tells me that you have been suspected
of many thefts since school opened.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, oh!” cried Mary. “How dare she? How
dare any one? What have I done that these people
should try to make me out a thief? Oh,
mother, mother!”
</p>
<p>
“That is just why I brought you up here to-night,
Mary. On account of your sweet, lovely
mother. I want you to make me a promise in
return for what I am going to do for you. I
promise not to push this matter any farther. It
shall never reach your mother’s ears. She will
be spared all distress and misery, if you promise
me never again, as long as you live, to steal. It
was not nice of you, Mary, staying here as my
guest, to steal from me. Will you make me that
promise?”
</p>
<p>
Mary did not reply. She sat down and clasped
her hands in her lap. Once or twice her throat
quivered with the little sob, which so went to
Billie’s heart. She pressed her hands together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
and closed her eyes for a moment. Her face was
so pale that Mrs. St. Clair thought she was going
to faint, but her lips were moving.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, God, help me,” she prayed softly. “Tell
me what to say.”
</p>
<p>
Presently her agitation ceased altogether. She
opened her eyes and looked calmly at the widow.
</p>
<p>
“No, I will not promise you that, Mrs. St.
Clair, because I have never stolen anything in
my life. I would prefer that my mother should
know about this. I don’t wish to keep it from
her. She would never believe me guilty, no matter
what the evidence was against me, even if I
had to go to jail. You say you found the necklace
in my bag? How did you happen to look
for it there?”
</p>
<p>
“You see, I believed that Fannie Alta had taken
it, and when we brought her into the living room
and urged her to tell what she knew, she accused
you. I would not believe it, however, until I had
called up Miss Gray. It was only after that that
I looked in your bag.”
</p>
<p>
Mary stood up.
</p>
<p>
“I know that things look very black for me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
Mrs. St. Clair. I don’t understand why, but
there is a conspiracy in the High School. It
seems to have formed around Billie and me in
particular. But there is something else, too.
Something is going on in West Haven—something
too big for us to understand. Billie and
I are in it, and Fannie Alta is in it, and sometimes
I think even Belle Rogers is, too. I don’t
know what it all means, or why it should have
anything to do with making me a thief, but I am
not a thief, and I did not put the necklace in my
bag. Good-night. I will not see you again. As
soon as morning comes, Billie and I will go back
in the motor. I know she will take me if I ask
her.”
</p>
<p>
Mary walked quietly out of the room.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a girl of fine spirit,” thought Mr.
Bangs. “The case is certainly interesting enough
to keep me here another week.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX.—MISS CAMPBELL WEARS BLACK.</h2>
<p>
Mary went straight to her room that night
and packed her bag. When Billie came up a little
later she found her kneeling beside her bed,
her face hidden in her hands. It seemed to the
unhappy young girl in her misery and danger
that no human power could aid her.
</p>
<p>
When Billie heard the story, she was so angry
with Mrs. St. Clair and Miss Gray and Fannie
Alta that she took an imaginary aim and pitched
both shoes across the room with all her force.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear, my dear,” she cried, throwing
her arms about her friend’s neck with affectionate
fervor, “you have at least one devoted friend
who will stand by you through everything.”
</p>
<p>
Mary was touched by Billie’s devotion and by
and by the two girls dropped off to sleep in spite
of their troubled hearts.
</p>
<p>
But they were up and dressed before any one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
except the servants was stirring in the house.
Randolph, greatly amazed, and imploring the
young ladies to wait and take at least a cup of
coffee, led the way to the carriage house where
the motor had been left.
</p>
<p>
“Tell Mrs. St. Clair,” said Billie, “that I was
called home early and will write to her.”
</p>
<p>
No one knew but the colored servant, and he
did not understand, that Mary and Billie had refused
to eat anything in a house where one of
them had been called a thief.
</p>
<p>
“Mary, tell your mother the whole story,” said
Billie, as she dropped her friend at “The Sign of
the Blue Tea Pot.” “Tell her not to be uneasy.
Your friends know you are innocent and it is
all obliged to come out right.”
</p>
<p>
Then she dashed around the Square, turned up
Cliff Street, and stopped at the home of Miss
Helen Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t had breakfast,” she said to the
old man servant, who opened the door. “I’ll eat
with Cousin Helen if she hasn’t breakfasted.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Campbell will not eat any breakfast this
morning, Miss Billie,” replied the butler.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is she ill?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss,” the old man lowered his voice,
“but she’s wearing her black dress.”
</p>
<p>
Billie frowned.
</p>
<p>
“Is it an anniversary?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss. That’s just the queer part. It
ain’t the anniversary. We know when that comes
now. But something’s happened.”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing to do with papa?” she asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No, no, Miss.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have some breakfast, then,” she said. “I’m
very hungry from the ride in town.”
</p>
<p>
Billie ate a hurried but hearty meal alone.
</p>
<p>
“I never can do anything when I’m empty,”
she often said, and instinctively she felt that
trouble of some sort was brewing.
</p>
<p>
After breakfast she tapped on her cousin’s
door.
</p>
<p>
“Come in,” came the tremulous answer, and
Billie entered a darkened room.
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell, looking faded and pale and
wearing a black crepe dress, was sitting alone at
the far end of her apartment. Her hands were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
crossed on her breast like a mediæval saint’s, and
she looked the very picture of hopeless misery.
</p>
<p>
“Dear Cousin Helen, what has happened?”
cried Billie, running to the little lady and kneeling
beside her chair. “Is it something very terrible?”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell put her arm around the girl’s
neck and two tears slipped down her faded
cheeks.
</p>
<p>
“Billie, Billie, why have you deceived me so?”
she exclaimed. “How could you have done this
terrible thing? Oh, my dear, my dear, I have
been so unhappy, and Mrs. Price, too. We have
wept together.”
</p>
<p>
“What in the world?” cried Billie.
</p>
<p>
“The jewels, my dear. The box of wonderful
jewels that you have kept. How could you have
done such a thing? I know many young girls
who would have been tempted by them. But not
you, my dear, dear Billie. And Mary, too. Oh,
heavens, I am so unhappy!”
</p>
<p>
Miss Campbell was so shaken by her sobs and
weeping that Billie was obliged to wipe her eyes
with her own handkerchief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, dearest Cousin,” she said at last. “We
haven’t done anything dishonest, or that we
might be ashamed of. How did you find out
about the box and who told you such a slander
about us?”
</p>
<p>
After being bolstered up with aromatic nerve
drops and eau de cologne, Miss Campbell was able
to speak coherently.
</p>
<p>
“Yesterday a man came here to see me. He
sent up his name and the message that he wished
to speak to me about something in regard to you,
so I had him shown in. And then, my child, he
told me such a story. How his motor car had
been wrecked on the very day we went to Shell
Island and a box of jewels belonging to his wife
had fallen in the sand. He had good reason to
know, he said, that you had found the jewels and,
instead of trying to find the owner or answering
advertisements and notes, had kept them all this
time in Mrs. Price’s safe. He gave me a list of
the jewels and an exact description. I went at
once to Mrs. Price. We found the combination,
opened the safe, and got out the box. There
they were, just as he had described them. Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
my dear, what mortification! What will your
father say?”
</p>
<p>
“Did you give him the jewels?” exclaimed
Billie, without waiting to make explanations until
this important point was settled.
</p>
<p>
“The man was very insistent. He has threatened
to arrest you and Mary and even Mrs.
Price. Think of that! For harboring stolen
goods.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you give them to him?” cried Billie, impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“No, Mrs. Price refused to let him have them
until she had seen you and Mary. For my part, I
should have given them to the man and let him go.
We had a terrible scene with him, but Mrs. Price
was firm. She said it would do no harm for him
to wait until she had seen you and she would not
allow him to take them.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank heavens for that,” burst out Billie.
“Then the box is in Mrs. Price’s safe?”
</p>
<p>
“No, I had it brought here for safe-keeping.
The man was so angry he made threats and I
thought it would be better to get it away from
Mrs. Price’s at least.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
</p>
<p>
“What was the man’s name?”
</p>
<p>
“Lafitte. He wrote it on a piece of paper.”
</p>
<p>
“Lafitte?” echoed Billie. “What did he look
like?”
</p>
<p>
“I cannot really recall, my dear. I was so
agitated. But I think there was something
wrong about one eye.”
</p>
<p>
“He had only one eye,” Billie almost shrieked
in her excitement.
</p>
<p>
“I believe so, and only one arm. But you will
see him. He will be back this morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Cousin Helen, he will never come back. He
is a thief and a robber and a smuggler. He is
everything that is wicked and bad. I don’t know
how he found out that we had the jewels, but he
has been hot on our track ever since. I will tell
you the real story of the jewels and then you
will see what an injustice you have done us.”
</p>
<p>
When Billie had finished the strange tale, Miss
Campbell looked at her with a peculiar expression.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a very remarkable story, my dear. And
if I did not know you as well as I do, I could
almost think you had imagined it. And I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
there all the time. You should have confided in
me. The woman was insane, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“She was not,” insisted Billie. “She was perfectly
sane and very beautiful. The man who
calls himself ‘Lafitte’ is not the right person, and
he shall not have the jewels until I hear from
her or from the right Lafitte. You may be sure
he will not dare have me or any one else arrested.
We know too much about him already.”
</p>
<p>
“But what are we to do with the things, child?
They have brought nothing but trouble on you
since you have had them.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose you put them in your safety box at
the bank for a few days. There is something
much more important than this at stake now.
Mary has been accused of being a thief by Mrs.
St. Clair and Miss Gray. It is a terrible thing.
Mrs. St. Clair wouldn’t listen to reason.”
</p>
<p>
Billie related to her cousin what had happened
the day before and the chain of events which
led up to it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, poor dear Mrs. Price! My unfortunate
friend. What shall we do, Billie?” exclaimed
the sympathetic little woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know yet, Cousin Helen. The whole
thing is too much for me, but I have a scheme.
Are there any detectives in West Haven?”
</p>
<p>
“Call up the police station,” her cousin suggested,
and presently Billie’s voice could be heard
in the hall:
</p>
<p>
“Have you a good detective? Bangs, you say.
Send him to Miss Campbell’s please; upper Cliff
Street, and the sooner the better. Good-by.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—THE MISSING LINK.</h2>
<p>
Mr. Bangs made three calls on that memorable
Monday. The first was to Billie, as you already
surmise. If he recognized the strong undercurrent
which connected the strange adventures of
the Motor Maids during the past two months, he
said nothing, but listened gravely to the young
girl’s account of the happenings in Boulder Lane,
the box of jewels, the cases of rifles at Seven
League Island, and so on through the events
which have been told in this history.
</p>
<p>
When Billie had finished, she paused and
waited for the detective to speak, but he sat silently
twirling his thumbs and looking down at
the floor with half-closed eyes.
</p>
<p>
Billie was slightly irritated.
</p>
<p>
“I have sent for you, Mr. Bangs,” she continued
with some dignity, “because, while I am certain
of two things, I’m not at all sure of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
third. The first is that Fannie Alta has some
very good reason for trying to prove that Mary
is a thief. The second is that this smuggler who
has been trying to steal the jewels has something
to do with it.”
</p>
<p>
“And what is the third, Miss Campbell?” asked
the detective, smiling, without looking up.
</p>
<p>
“That is what I want you to tell me,” exclaimed
Billie restlessly. “There is a third. It is the
missing link. And it is what I wanted you to
find out for me. I have thought and thought and
puzzled and puzzled, but I can’t make it out. I
believe with all my soul that there is some wicked
force back of the whole thing.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bangs raised his eyes at last and looked
at the young girl with evident admiration.
</p>
<p>
“You are taking the first step toward making
a good detective, Miss Campbell,” he said. “You
have expressed it in three words. It is the missing
link we need to get at in this business and it
is what I must find.”
</p>
<p>
Billie flushed with pleasure at this professional
praise. She had never had occasion to play the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
part of detective before. But devotion and loyalty
to her friend had sharpened her wits.
</p>
<p>
“Now, why?” asked the detective. “Isn’t Miss
Alta the missing link?”
</p>
<p>
“That is the strangest part of the whole business.
She is a piece of the link, I think, but then
she has nothing against Mary and me. There
would be no object to what she has done unless
she had.”
</p>
<p>
“You did not know that she accused you of
being the confederate of your friend or that she
knew that you had the box of jewels hidden in
the safe?”
</p>
<p>
“What?” cried Billie, with amazement. “But
how did she know——” she began.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, how?”
</p>
<p>
Billie sat looking down at her hands. She was
not thinking of those slender, strong fingers,
which appeared to clasp each other with a
friendly grip. Her thoughts were busy going
back over the past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ve found the missing link,” she said
at last, with a serious look in her eyes, as she
turned toward the detective. “Belle Rogers is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
the missing link. I can’t understand why I
haven’t thought of it before, but it seemed so incredible.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Campbell,” put in Mr. Bangs severely,
“I am afraid you are not such a good detective,
after all. You have left out one of the most important
things. You did not tell me that some
one besides your three friends knew about the
jewels.”
</p>
<p>
Billie had omitted the story of the confusion of
the two suit cases at Shell Island. She had really
quite forgotten it and Mr. Bangs chuckled with
amusement when he heard how Belle had opened
and examined all the contents of another girl’s
suit case out of pure curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“Then she must have read the name on the
card, too,” he said presently.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, tell me, Miss Campbell, what is the
grudge which this young lady perhaps has
against you and your friends?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s only a silly schoolgirl affair,” replied
Billie. “I am ashamed to tell you, because it
seems so utterly trivial in comparison to other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
things. She was angry because I wouldn’t join
her club and because we saw her the night of the
fire with her hair up in rubber curlers.”
</p>
<p>
The detective laughed outright.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a woman’s reason for taking revenge,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
“And she was angry again because I took her
into the wrong room, when the hotel was burning
and we had to escape over the roof.”
</p>
<p>
“Humph!” exclaimed the detective. “Insult
piled onto injury, eh? So this Miss Rogers is a
very vindictive character?”
</p>
<p>
Billie hesitated. It went against her straight-forward,
honest nature to malign even Belle
Rogers.
</p>
<p>
“She has been spoiled all her life,” she said,
“and you know how spoiled children must have
their own way. That is all. She was angry because
she planned to make me a member of her
club and queen it over me as she does over the
others, and I disappointed her. Her mother and
friends have taken good care always that she
should never be disappointed and she just didn’t
know what the feeling was, I suppose.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
</p>
<p>
“She must be quite a remarkably spoiled young
woman to go to such lengths for such a trivial
offence. But we sometimes get in deeper than
we intend, you know.”
</p>
<p>
The detective rose to go.
</p>
<p>
“Good day, Miss Campbell,” he said, giving her
hand quite a warm grip, considering what a quiet,
cold individual he had seemed at first. “You will
hear from me again, soon. I had not intended to
work when I came down here. You know I am
a West Haven boy. My father was old Bill
Bangs, the jailer. You probably have heard of
him. He was a famous character in his day. I
came home to rest and see my people, but when a
detective scents a good case he is not apt to let
it slip by, even on a holiday.”
</p>
<p>
“And you think this is a good case?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a corking one,” he replied, as he closed the
door after him.
</p>
<p>
Billie and Mary did not go to school that famous
Monday. Billie had no mind to face the
curious looks she felt certain would be turned
upon her by the other girls, because news travels
quickly in any school. Mary was lying on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
mother’s bed with a throbbing sick headache. All
day Mrs. Price sat beside her daughter and held
her hand. At intervals she bathed her temples
with eau de cologne and whispered:
</p>
<p>
“My dearest, it will come out all right. Mother
loves you and believes in you and so does Billie.
Don’t sob like that for my sake, my little girl.”
</p>
<p>
Belle Rogers also stayed at home that Monday.
Mr. Bangs discovered this fact on his second
visit of the day when he was closeted for an hour
or more with Miss Gray and Mrs. St. Clair in the
principal’s private office.
</p>
<p>
After a tiresome interview with these two well
meaning but mistaken ladies, in which he said little
and they said much, he left the High School
with a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
Presently he found himself in the fashionable
district of West Haven. It was the second time
he had climbed the street that day, but he was a
calm little person, not easily heated by emotion
or exercise, and when he rang the bell at the
Rogers home, there was just the suspicion of a
smile on his face. He sent up his card for Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
Rogers and word was brought back that Miss
Rogers was ill and not to be seen. Then, with
a pencil, he wrote across the face of the card,
“Lafitte—Paris.”
</p>
<p>
In three minutes the swish of skirts down the
steps announced that some one was coming.
</p>
<p>
“I hope it’s not the mother,” he said to himself.
</p>
<p>
But it was Belle, very pale, with violet circles
around her eyes and a nervous quivering about
the lips.
</p>
<p>
When Mr. Bangs left the Rogers house after
spending three-quarters of an hour with Belle,
he remarked as he strolled down the gravel driveway
to the street:
</p>
<p>
“It will have to be an out and out confession
from one or the other. If this one doesn’t give
it, the Alta girl must. I shall pay my respects
to Mme. Alta this evening.”
</p>
<p>
He had hardly passed through the great iron
gateway leading into the street, when Belle,
wearing a heavy veil and a long ulster, hurried
after him. She carried a music roll under her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
arm, although she was not taking lessons, since
she had been injured in the fire, but it was understood
by the servant who opened the door for her
that she was going to see Mme. Alta.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—THE REFUGEES.</h2>
<p>
A ship had sailed into the little harbor of West
Haven on Monday morning. She carried a load
of lumber from down the coast and after showing
her clearance papers and discharging her
cargo with all due formality, she hoisted sails
again and moved around the curve of the harbor
into a deep inlet, where she rested at anchor in
a position just opposite Boulder Lane.
</p>
<p>
Darkness fell very early that Monday afternoon
as those who were not in their homes will
remember.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Bangs will recall the inky blackness of the
lowering sky, as he came out of the telegraph
office, where he had wired to his chief to send
down another man, and turned his steps toward
the rooms occupied by Mme. Alta.
</p>
<p>
Our Motor Maids have not forgotten how they
sped back to town after a swift ride in their beloved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
“Comet,” in the late afternoon, when they
discussed the situation long and earnestly.
</p>
<p>
Three figures turned into Boulder Lane as the
motor car flashed past, but the girls were too intent
on their conversation to notice them. The
first, who was a tall, stout woman, walked
stoically along with the tread of a grenadier. She
carried a large suit case with one hand and an
enormous bundle with the other. Her two upper
teeth protruding over her lower lip gave her that
strange animal look which Billie had disliked so
much. For it was Mme. Alta, as you have no
doubt guessed, trudging up Boulder Lane. Her
daughter, Francesca, walked behind. She also
carried a suit case and a bundle. Occasionally
she flashed a look of hatred back to the lights of
West Haven, which place she had never loved.
</p>
<p>
Can this be Belle Rogers who brings up the
procession, staggering under a heavy satchel and
moaning and weeping as she stumbles along?
</p>
<p>
“I am glad I left word that I had gone out
to spend the night,” she said to herself. “At
least, they won’t know it for a while, and it will
be too late then.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
It was a long walk before they reached the
end of Boulder Lane and found themselves on the
beach of the little cove. The lights of the ship
made a rippling, cheerful track on the water, but
Belle shivered when she saw the black hull outlined
in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
Several men were waiting for them near a
boat, which had been moored on the beach, and
presently the three women climbed in; their luggage
was piled at one end and they were rowed
away in the darkness. Two wagons came lumbering
up the beach, and half the night, Belle,
who was tossing feverishly in her stuffy berth,
trying to stifle her sobs, heard the sailors loading
a cargo, while the boats plied back and forth from
the shore to the ship.
</p>
<p>
There was no wind that night and an ominous
silence seemed to brood over the sea. At last in
the stillness, Belle slept. Toward morning she
was awakened by the sound of a voice. A man
in a small boat just below her porthole was calling
up to some one on deck.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Captain, it’s Ruiz. I’m coming aboard.
We must sail by dawn. They’ve got word about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
us. If that girl has turned traitor, she shall pay
for it.”
</p>
<p>
Belle could not hear the captain’s reply, but he
must have made some objection to sailing that
morning, for the man named Ruiz answered:
</p>
<p>
“Storm or no storm, I’m master here, and I
say we sail at once.”
</p>
<p>
And sail they did without more argument. She
could hear the sailors running about the ship.
The masts creaked and groaned. Chains rattled.
Presently the boat was in motion, and from her
porthole she saw the familiar shores glide past
her.
</p>
<p>
We cannot help pitying poor Belle in her misery
and distress. She dragged herself from her
berth—Fannie was still sleeping soundly—and
put on her clothes. For the first time, she became
aware of a sustained and ever-increasing sound.
What she had mistaken in the beginning for the
eternal noise of the waters, she recognized now
as the wind. As she cast one long regretful look
back to the shores of West Haven, which she
had never really loved until now, the hurricane
burst upon them with a roar like a thousand angry beasts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
The ship went scurrying through the
harbor entrance in the teeth of the gale.
</p>
<p>
Belle hurried upstairs to the deck, pulling on
her ulster as she ran. Not a vestige of curl had
the wet air left in her light gold hair; but for
the first time in her life, since she had been old
enough to remember, she had forgotten that she
had any hair and she did not even stop to push
back the damp, uneven locks from her eyes.
</p>
<p>
The boat had cleared the Black Reefs and was
making for the open sea, when suddenly the
demon wind played a trick on the captain of the
little schooner and changed its tack. Down went
the mainmast with a great crash. Through the
shrieking of the wind, Belle could hear the curses
and cries of the sailors and the yells of the captain.
Mme. Alta appeared, looking more than
ever like a walrus, in her greasy old black dressing
gown. Fannie ran up behind her, making a
great outcry.
</p>
<p>
The hurricane seemed to lift the ship in its
arms and carry it along. Then, with a hideous
grinding noise, the vessel stood perfectly still.
</p>
<p>
Some one screamed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’re on the rocks!”
</p>
<p>
And Belle knew without being told that they
had tossed onto the Black Reefs.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Wake up, Billie,” cried Nancy, shaking her
friend’s shoulder violently. “Get up and dress.
We are all waiting below.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s happened?” asked Billie, sitting up in
bed and rubbing her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“A ship is wrecked on the Black Reefs.”
</p>
<p>
Billie leaped from her bed and began to dress
hurriedly.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a fearful sight,” she exclaimed, as
she pulled on her clothes. “The poor sailors, will
they be saved?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t heard,” answered Nancy, “but the
whole town is rushing up the Cliff Road.”
</p>
<p>
“Tell Ben to get ‘The Comet.’ He can run it as
well as I can now.”
</p>
<p>
“He has,” answered Nancy, with the privilege
of friendship. “I made him get it while I routed
you out.”
</p>
<p>
In another five minutes “The Comet,” with its
load of boys and girls,—only Mary and Percy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
were missing,—was climbing Cliff Road in a
driving hurricane of wind.
</p>
<p>
A straggling line of people hurried along the
path toward the Life-Saving Station.
</p>
<p>
“Is that it?” demanded Billie breathlessly,
when the car had come to a standstill opposite
the light house.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Merry, looking through the
glasses. “She doesn’t look much larger than a
fishing smack from this distance, but she’s really
a pretty big schooner and she’s in a bad fix, too.
She has stuck right on the Serpent’s Fang, Ben.
You remember that old fisherman showed it to us
last summer when we were sailing? It’s a
pointed rock that sticks up higher than the others
and it looked to be a pretty fierce proposition to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“The life-boat is being launched!” exclaimed
Elinor.
</p>
<p>
They clutched each other in their excitement,
while a boat, with six brave life-savers in it,
leapt onto the crest of a big wave, only to be
hurled back again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’ll have to use the gun,” put in Charlie.
“They’ll never make it in this sea.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” shouted Billie. It was
almost impossible to be heard now above the noise
of the wind.
</p>
<p>
But before any one could shout back an explanation,
her attention was claimed by a man in
a long, thick ulster, buttoned to his chin, and a
vizored cap pulled well over his eyes. He had
come to the front of the motor car and, bowing
to Billie politely, he stood on tiptoe and beckoned
to her to lean down.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll be surprised to hear that you have
friends on that ship,” he said in her ear, and she
recognized Mr. Bangs.
</p>
<p>
“Friends?” she repeated, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Wait and see,” he replied, as he moved away
to join another man, who was leaning against a
tree smoking a cigar.
</p>
<p>
“Look!” cried some one, and just as Billie
shifted her gaze from the ship to the beach she
saw a long black line shoot out over the water
and light on the deck of the ship. It was very
confusing then, what happened. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
great deal of shouting on shore and scurrying of
sailors on the ship. Presently there seemed to
be a double line of rope stretching out to the
wreck.
</p>
<p>
After a long pause, Billie saw, creeping along
one of the lines of rope, swaying and swinging
almost to sea level, an object which appeared
to be shaped like a pair of clumsy trouser legs
with the head and shoulders of a human being
above.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a woman,” cried Nancy, jumping up and
down in her excitement, as she looked through
the glasses. “It’s—it’s——”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Mme. Alta,” exclaimed Billie, as the
woman was lifted onto the beach.
</p>
<p>
No one could explain why the music teacher
should be found on a wrecked schooner, but Mr.
Bangs and Billie exchanged meaning glances as
Mme. Alta was supported into the Life-Saving
Station.
</p>
<p>
The next time the buoy was drawn into shore
it carried Fannie Alta, a shivering, wretched little
figure, who followed her mother silently into
the life-savers’ house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who can the third one be?” said Billie out
loud, although she was speaking to herself. “Can
it be——”
</p>
<p>
She jumped out of the car and ran down the
path to the beach, followed by her three chums.
As she passed Mr. Bangs, he caught her by the
arm and said in her ear:
</p>
<p>
“The missing link.”
</p>
<p>
No one but Billie and Mr. Bangs recognized
Belle Rogers in the miserable object which now
crawled out of the breeches buoy. Her face was
blue and pinched with cold. Her damp hair hung
in her eyes, and she moaned and sobbed most
pitifully.
</p>
<p>
When she saw Billie, she flung her wet arms
around the young girl’s neck.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, forgive me! Forgive me!” she wept.
</p>
<p>
A crowd of people gathered around them.
</p>
<p>
Billie patted her on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“I do forgive you,” she whispered, “and if you
would rather not go into the station, we will take
you home in ‘The Comet.’”
</p>
<p>
“Any place but home,” sobbed Belle, as Ben
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
threw his ulster around her shivering shoulders
and Nancy wrapped a scarf about her head.
</p>
<p>
The others had now recognized the poor girl,
and with a generous impulse they tried to shield
her from the gaze of the villagers.
</p>
<p>
“Will you go to Cousin Helen’s, then?” asked
Belle, as they half carried her up the steep path.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she answered, and in another ten minutes
the miserable refugee was being tenderly
ministered to at Billie’s home by three of the most
detested members of the Blue Bird Society.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—BELLE’S CONFESSION.</h2>
<p>
Belle, looking still very unlike herself, lay in
Billie’s little brass bed, propped up on pillows.
</p>
<p>
“How can you and Miss Campbell be so kind
to me,” she was saying, “when you know how
wicked I have been?”
</p>
<p>
“But you are sorry and that means everything,”
answered Billie, who was sitting on the side of
the bed, feeding her hot beef tea.
</p>
<p>
“When are the others coming?” asked the invalid.
</p>
<p>
“They have come. I was just going to tell you
after you had finished the tea. Shall I call
them?”
</p>
<p>
Belle nodded, and presently Miss Gray and
Mary Price came into the room.
</p>
<p>
The Principal took the sick girl’s hand kindly.
</p>
<p>
“Speak out from the heart, Belle,” she said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
“and don’t be afraid. You will be much happier
when you get it off your mind.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise to, Miss Gray,” replied Belle
meekly, gazing miserably at Mary, who looked
pale and ill.
</p>
<p>
Miss Gray sat in a judicial looking armchair;
Mary, with closed eyes, lay on a lounge near the
fire, and Billie seated herself on the foot of the
bed.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” began Belle, “it would be almost
impossible for you to believe that a well brought
up girl of decent family could be as wicked as
I have been. When I finally realized what I had
done I thought I would rather run away to South
America with those terrible people than stay here
and bear the shame of it all. But I thank heavens
for the storm. The ship was not sailing for
any good purpose. I feel sure of that.
</p>
<p>
“To begin at the beginning, perhaps you didn’t
know how angry I was when you joined the Blue
Birds, Billie? I hope I shall never be angry
again. I was ill from it and I lay on my bed all
afternoon planning a revenge on all the Blue
Birds, but you, especially. I think I must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
been insane with rage and mortification. I
wanted to humiliate you, because I thought you
had humiliated me before the whole school. I
thought of dozens of ways of doing it, but the
only plan that seemed good enough was to
prove——”
</p>
<p>
She paused and bit her lip.
</p>
<p>
“To prove that you were—a—thief.”
</p>
<p>
There was a long silence. Nothing could be
heard but the ticking of the little French clock on
the mantel. Miss Gray had started and flushed
crimson. She was only just now realizing what
this confession must mean to the two girls.
</p>
<p>
“I asked Fannie Alta to help me because she
was the only outsider in the class, but I never
dreamed that she was a real thief, herself. She
found out what it was I wanted her to do almost
before I had half breathed it to myself, only
she was afraid of Billie and put it on Mary. It
was my twenty dollars she used, but we found
the scheme didn’t work. Anyhow, she told it all
over school and went so much farther than I had
intended that I soon found myself too deeply involved
to get out. She and her mother owned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
me, body and soul. I had to take Fannie with
me everywhere I went, even to Mrs. St. Clair’s.
I had to give her my clothes, and explain to
mamma that she was my best friend. Her mother
made me carry letters and messages back and
forth. Once I had to go by myself all the way
to Boulder Lane after dusk and meet a horrible
creature who had only one eye and one arm.
He gave me a letter for Mme. Alta. Another
time I was to meet one of them, a man who
helped him, up in the Sophomore class room of
the High School. I didn’t go, because there was
such a mist.”
</p>
<p>
Billie and Mary exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>
“He was the man who robbed us of the fifty
dollars,” said Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Then whose fifty dollars was it I got?” demanded
Miss Gray.
</p>
<p>
“My monthly allowance,” replied Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Foolish, foolish girls,” said the Principal.
“But it was my own fault. I blame no one else,
and perhaps I wouldn’t have believed the story
just at that time.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” continued Belle, “the most dreadful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
thing of all happened. These people were always
in need of money. Everything they had seemed
to go to some object. The one-eyed man, who
was Fannie’s stepfather, was to get some high
position in South America. She used to tell me
what she was going to do when he was made Vice
President, or something. When we went to the
St. Clair’s, Fannie was almost unbearable. She
made me give her my dress and I had to wear
hers, and she insulted me at every turn. But I
didn’t find out until after the party that her stepfather
had been there dressed as a ghost. He
wanted to rob Mrs. St. Clair. It was Fannie who
took the necklace. She was to go back later and
give it to him, so that if her bag was searched
the next morning, when the necklace was missed,
it wouldn’t be found. But she made me go back
instead, after every one else was asleep, I supposed.
It was terrible, when I found myself
alone in the attic, with the necklace hidden under
my wrapper. No one was there. The man must
have been frightened and run away. Then I
heard all of you come and I threw a sheet over me
and hid in a far corner.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
“It <em>was</em> you, then?” exclaimed Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and when I met you and Mary I had
the necklace with me and I didn’t think I had
strength enough to get to my room. When we
got home from Mrs. Ruggles’ next day and I
found Fannie had been sent to town, I knew
something had happened. I thought perhaps she
might have taken the necklace with her, but the
next morning, when you and Mary left before
breakfast, I was certain that one of you had been
accused.
</p>
<p>
“You never can understand how I suffered.
And yet it was what I had planned when I was
so angry. Late Monday afternoon Mr. Bangs, a
detective, came to see me. He wrote across his
card ‘Pierre Lafitte,’ and I was convinced then
that he knew everything.”
</p>
<p>
“You did tell Fannie about the card that was
in the box of jewels, then?”
</p>
<p>
Belle hung her head.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she said, at last. “In the very beginning,
before I had learned to loathe her and myself
so, I told it to Fannie.
</p>
<p>
“After Mr. Bangs had left,” she went on, “I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
hurried as fast as I could to Mme. Alta’s lodgings
and told her that everything had been discovered.
The husband came in while I was there
and ordered her to leave at once. The ship was
in the harbor, he said. I was ordered to go, too,
and it really did seem best. I felt I should be disgraced
if I stayed and I was too miserable to
reason much, anyway. They were glad to go.
They hated it here, and they were afraid to leave
me, I suppose, for fear I would tell. Ever since
they were almost caught in Smugglers’ Cave,
they have been very careful.
</p>
<p>
“I have made a great many people suffer,”
Belle went on, “Mary and Billie and Mrs. Price
and Mrs. St. Clair, and I have suffered, too, perhaps
more than any of you. But I have learned a
great deal. I never knew before what a wicked,
spoiled girl I was. Mamma and papa never denied
me anything in my life. I have been indulged
and petted until I have been nothing but a
bundle of selfishness. When the ship was wrecked
and we thought we were going to sink any minute
the scales dropped entirely from my eyes and I
saw myself as I really was. I knelt on the deck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
and prayed and prayed for forgiveness until they
came and told me it was my turn to be taken to
shore.
</p>
<p>
“You will forgive me, won’t you Mary? I will
do everything I can to make up for the trouble
and unhappiness I have caused you.”
</p>
<p>
Belle stretched out her arms toward Mary and
tears flowed down her cheeks and splashed on the
coverlid.
</p>
<p>
Miss Gray wiped her eyes and Billie’s face
worked convulsively for a moment and she
choked back a lump which would rise in her
throat on occasions.
</p>
<p>
Mary came over and took Belle’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I forgive you, Belle,” she said, kissing
the repentant girl on the lips.
</p>
<p>
“But I must ask your forgiveness, too, Mary,”
cried Miss Gray. “I feel I am not fit to be the
principal of the High School to have so misjudged
you. It was only the strange way you
acted about the fifty dollars which made me credit
for a moment the stories that were told.”
</p>
<p>
When peace was entirely restored, Miss Gray
took her departure. She did not return to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
High School, but hurried to the livery stable,
where she ordered a carriage and had herself
driven straight to Mrs. St. Clair’s.
</p>
<p>
As Belle will not again appear in this story,
you will perhaps be interested to know how sincere
her reformation really was. Her mother
and father scarcely recognized the pale, quiet girl
who returned to them in another day. Her entire
nature had been shaken by the experience,
and for some time she was dazed and silent. But
no one ever saw her angry again, and as if she
wished to give some visible sign of her repentance,
the red rubber curlers were thrown away
and from that time she has worn her hair
straight.
</p>
<p>
There was no evidence against Mme. Alta or
Fannie, except what Belle Rogers could furnish,
and they were finally allowed to go free. But
they were not permitted to remain in quiet West
Haven, where suspicious characters were not welcomed.
</p>
<p>
The police cared little for the music teacher
and her daughter. The prize they looked for
was Ruiz, the famous filibuster and desperado
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
who had smuggled hundreds of rifles into Venezuela
and had robbed and pillaged and even
killed, but had never been caught.
</p>
<p>
Detective Bangs, standing on the shore, the
day of the shipwreck, scanned eagerly the face
of each sailor as he was drawn ashore. But Ruiz
was not among them. It was supposed that he
preferred death to arrest; for he remained on the
sinking ship. But the sturdy little vessel clung
desperately to the Serpent’s Fang until after sunset,
and there are some who believe that Ruiz
swam ashore with his one arm, which was as
strong as iron, and is still at large somewhere
working mischief and misfortune.
</p>
<p>
On the day after the departure of Mme. Alta
and Fannie, Miss Gray called a meeting of the
Faculty and pupils of West Haven High School.
Mary Price was there and so was Billie, and in
the gallery sat Mrs. Price between Mrs. St. Clair
and Miss Campbell.
</p>
<p>
“I called this meeting,” said Miss Gray, “because
I wanted to make an announcement to all
of you at once, since the subject of the announcement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
concerns us all. We have recently had a
very clever thief in our midst. She has robbed
many of you and has brought unjust suspicion
on some innocent persons by spreading reports.
This girl has been dismissed from the school and
from West Haven. She will never trouble us
again.
</p>
<p>
“Some of us have suffered deeply for the last
few weeks on account of this disgrace and scandal
in the school, and I don’t mind confessing that
I have been one of those persons. I know that
you will all rejoice with me that the affair is concluded.
</p>
<p>
“I want to say further, that at a specially called
meeting, the Board of Education has consented
to add a new post to the school force. This position,
which is that of private and confidential
secretary to the principal and has a salary attached,
is to be filled by Miss Mary Price. I hope
you will all congratulate me on my good fortune
in obtaining so competent and reliable an assistant.”
</p>
<p>
There was wild applause when this announcement was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
made and Mary, smiling and happy,
with her three devoted friends about her, was
obliged to rise and bow her blushing acknowledgments
to her schoolmates.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—OUT OF THE MISTS.</h2>
<p>
The Motor Maids were gathered in Mrs.
Brown’s sunny parlor around a cheerful driftwood
fire. You may easily guess it was Saturday
morning, because Nancy was darning stockings,
Elinor was at the piano, Mary was reading,
while Billie lay flat on her back on the hearth rug,
her hands crossed under her head, thinking
deeply.
</p>
<p>
“I wish people were not so careless of their
diamond necklaces and things,” she observed, addressing
the ceiling with some irritation.
“Throwing them around in motor cars, giving
them to the first person who comes along, and
not caring to have them returned! It’s a nuisance——”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the door was thrown violently open
and Merry appeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Ruggles,” he announced, making a low
bow.
</p>
<p>
Nancy did not take the trouble to turn around.
Elinor went on playing and Mary reading. It
was only one of Merry’s jokes, they thought. But
Billie jumped up in amazement; for there actually
stood Mrs. Ruggles in the flesh—very much in
the flesh, in fact. She was dressed in decent
black and wore a black bonnet, and Billie could
not decide whether she resembled a queen disguised
as a fish-wife or a fish-wife dressed as a
lady.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it is Mrs. Ruggles,” cried Nancy, glancing
over her shoulder. “Merry plays so many
jokes that we can never tell when he is in earnest
and when he isn’t. Do come in, Mrs. Ruggles.
What brings you up to town so early?”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ruggles, who was slow of speech, did not
reply at first. She moved into the room with the
step of a grenadier and stood before Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Are you Miss Wilhelmina Campbell?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“She is the same,” put in Merry, “but she’ll
answer to the name of Billie.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
</p>
<p>
Billie nodded and smiled. She was really too
much engaged in admiring Mrs. Ruggles to reply
to her question.
</p>
<p>
Nancy pushed up an armchair.
</p>
<p>
“Please sit down, Mrs. Ruggles, and perhaps
you will have a cookie or a cup of tea.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Nancy, I am not hungry and I
couldn’t eat anyway, until I finished what I have
to say.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, Mrs. Ruggles. Get it off your
system. Are you going to scold Billie?” cried
Merry.
</p>
<p>
“No, my boy. I’m going to thank her. She’s
a fine young lady. I have just seen Miss Campbell
and she has told me.”
</p>
<p>
“Told you what?” asked Billie.
</p>
<p>
“Told me that you have kept the box of jewels
as you promised.”
</p>
<p>
“But——” began Billie, a dozen thoughts
flashing through her mind at once in tumultuous
confusion.
</p>
<p>
She saw again the face of the sick woman at
Mrs. Ruggles’, her long hair spread over the
pillow like a mantel of black and the troubled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
dark eyes which gazed into hers for one brief
moment.
</p>
<p>
“Then that was the automobile lady I saw in
your bedroom?” she burst out.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied the old woman. “That was my
daughter, Maria.”
</p>
<p>
“Is Maria home again?” asked Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“I thought she had married a South American,”
said Nancy.
</p>
<p>
“Maria is now a singer,” said Mrs. Ruggles
proudly. “She has sung in Buenos Ayres and
Paris, not in this country. Her husband was
from Venezuela. He was very rich and he gave
her many jewels. He loved her dearly for a few
years, until he began to like something else better.”
</p>
<p>
The old woman paused. It was extremely difficult
for her to speak at such great length when
she was so unaccustomed to talking at all.
</p>
<p>
“My daughter is very beautiful and very
clever. She will be a great singer. He was jealous
of her singing. He wished to be great, too,
and he became a politician. Gradually he spent
all of his money in making trouble for the government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
of his country. He wished to bring
about a war and make himself a ruler. My son,
my daughter’s step brother, pushed him on. He
was a bad boy, my only son. It is better that he
should be dead. He was always in the thick of
the fight. He couldn’t keep away. His arm was
shot off; his eye put out. But nothing could stop
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Was Ruiz really your son, John, who went
away to sea so many years ago?” interrupted
Nancy.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Ruggles nodded.
</p>
<p>
“What happened next, Mrs. Ruggles?” demanded
Billie.
</p>
<p>
“The next thing was that my Maria could not
stand the life any longer. She came back to
America with her jewels. They were all that was
left of her husband’s fortune and those he wanted
so much that he threatened her many times. If
he had wished to use them for a good purpose and
not for rifles to kill innocent people, Maria would
have given them gladly. But he was too clever
for her, that man. He followed on a fast steamer
and caught up with her before she could get to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>
me. He forced her to go with him in an automobile
down the Shell Island road to meet John,
my poor son, who was to take the jewels and sell
them. Maria always carried her jewelry in a
secret pocket inside of her skirt, but she had put
it in a box that day and wrapped the box in her
coat. Her husband did not know this. He
thought she had it in the usual place. When
they were upset going around a curve in the road
my Maria was very seriously injured. She is
still very lame. Her husband went away to get
another car and you know the rest.
</p>
<p>
“When they found out in a few hours that she
did not have the jewels they were very angry.
She told them the truth: that she had given them
to a young lady she had met, and asked her to
take care of them. Although she did not have the
name or address of this young lady, she knew
they would be safe.”
</p>
<p>
“And Mr. Lafitte?” began Billie.
</p>
<p>
“He is an old friend, a lawyer who lives in
Paris. She happened to have his card in her
pocket. But he had just started to America and
the letter she wrote, and your letter, came back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
here. That is how I happened to get your name
at last, Miss Wilhelmina. Mr. Lafitte was with
my daughter yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
“And what became of your son-in-law, Mrs.
Ruggles?” asked Elinor.
</p>
<p>
“He died some weeks ago,” replied Mrs. Ruggles.
“He was accidentally shot with one of his
own rifles, which exploded and killed him. My
son had his body sent to us and we laid him to
rest in the old Sabater burying ground, where
all my family is buried. It is better that he
should have died. He only made trouble while he
lived, not only for poor Maria, but for his country,
where many have been killed with the rifles
he has smuggled in. He was a good man until he
got in with those revolutionists. And my poor
son, my poor John, how much sorrow he has
brought us——”
</p>
<p>
Billie wondered if Mrs. Ruggles really knew
the extent of her poor son’s evil career. Perhaps
she did, for the old woman’s face twitched
nervously for a moment and she covered her eyes
with her hand, as if she wished to hide her unhappiness
from the young girls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maria and I are going away for a long time,”
she went on at last, with a rather shaky voice. “I
will close the Inn. It is hard for me to leave
home in my old age, but Maria wishes it, and it
is better for me to be with her. Good-by and
thank you,” she said simply, rising and taking
Billie’s hand.
</p>
<p>
Billie stood on tiptoe and put her arms around
Mrs. Ruggles’ neck.
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, Mrs. Ruggles,” she said. “I hope
that your troubles are all over now and you and
your daughter will be happy together.”
</p>
<p>
The old woman wiped her eyes. She could not
speak when she said good-by to the other girls,
but silently handed Billie a little package and
hurried away.
</p>
<p>
The package, when unwrapped, proved to be
a small box containing a pretty gold filigree necklace.
Written on a card inside was this message:
</p>
<p>
“With my love and gratitude. This is a simple
little necklace my father brought me once
from a voyage to the East. I am fond of it and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>
that is why I send it to you. Will you wear it
sometimes and think of me? I shall never forget
your kindness and loyalty.
</p>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>Maria Ruggles Cortina.</span>”
</p>
<p>
And now we have reached the end of our tale.
Those troublous first months of Billie Campbell’s
early school days in West Haven are changed into
happy, quiet times, with plenty of study and
plenty of play. All doubts and mysteries are
cleared up, and the Motor Maids, wholesome, nice
girls, are none the worse for their adventures.
</p>
<p>
It is in their beloved “Comet” that we see them
last, flashing down Main Street toward the open
country.
</p>
<p>
Billie, like the good pilot she is, is seated at the
wheel, her fine gray eyes ever on the lookout.
Nancy is bubbling over with laughter and gaiety.
Elinor, on the back seat, holds herself as proudly
as a queen, and little Mary, with a grave smile on
her face, looks out across the fields, her clear
eyes, deep as pools, holding and reflecting, as ever,
the beauty from without intensified by the purity
of the spirit within.

</p>
<p>
The friendship of these four school girls was
of the quality that outlives a single season and
many adventures. It held them together, in fact,
so closely that they often found themselves planning
for an indefinite future of partnership and
mutual pleasures. That they realized their anticipations
to some extent at least is assured,
for the next volume of this series, “The Motor
Maids by Palm and Pine,” is a further account
of their good times together.

</p>
<p>
The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys’ books—the
“wonders of modern science” epoch. Frank and Harry
Cheater, the BOY AVIATORS, are the heroes of this exciting,
red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic. The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the GOLDEN
EAGLE, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient
Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament. In a brand
new field of fiction for boys the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling
and geared up to third speed.

In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the spunky Chester
Boys and their interesting chums, including Ben Stubbs,
the maroon, encounter exciting experiences on Uncle
Sam’s service in a novel field. One must read this
vivid, enthralling story of incident, hardship and pluck
to get an idea of the almost limitless possibilities of
the two greatest inventions of modern times—the aeroplane
and wireless telegraphy. While gripping and
holding the reader’s breathless attention from the opening
words to the finish, this swift-moving story is at
the same time instructive and uplifting. As those
readers who have already made friends with Frank and
Harry Chester and their “bunch” know, there are few
difficulties, no matter how insurmountable they may
seem at first blush, that these up-to-date gritty youths
cannot overcome with flying colors. A clean-cut, real
boys’ book of high voltage.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
